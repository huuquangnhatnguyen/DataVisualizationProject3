 I can’t believe it. All this time I’ve been doing nothing but sit around and miss that guy. And you know what the worst part is?,Penny,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency

" Um, uh, in a hundred years, you’ll both be dead and it won’t matter?",Sheldon,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency

" Oh, no, I don’t think that’s true at all.",Sheldon,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency
 This is ridiculous. Why am I upset just because he’s off having a good time?,Penny,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency

" Okay, that, that’s great. You can stop trying to make me feel better now.",Penny,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency

 He did?,Penny,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency
 Yes.,Sheldon,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency

 I see. I own nine pairs of underpants.,Sheldon,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency
 How about I go first?,Penny,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency
" But I don’t want to know how many underpants you own. Although, based on the floor of your bedroom, I’d say it’s a thousand.",Sheldon,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency
" Okay, look, here’s something people do not know about me. When I first moved out to L.A., I did a topless scene in a low-budget horror movie about a killer gorilla. Ugh! After I did it, I felt so ashamed. Thankfully, that thing never came out.",Penny,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency
 I’ve seen that. Yeah. Serial Apeist. Howard found it online the day we met you.,Sheldon,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency
" Oh, God.",Penny,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency
" And it was literally the moment you walked out the door. But I see the type of personal revelations you’re going for. Okay, here’s one I thought I’d take to the grave.",Sheldon,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency
 Okay.,Penny,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency
" Hmm. A while back, YouTube changed its user interface from a star-based rating system to a thumbs-up rating system. I tell people I’m okay with it, but I’m really not.",Sheldon,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency
 That’s your big revelation?,Penny,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency
" Yes. Whew, I feel ten pounds lighter.",Sheldon,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency
" Okay, you know what? I give up. I’m going to bed.",Penny,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency
 Here’s something else you don’t know about me. You just hurt my feelings.,Sheldon,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency
 What did I do?,Penny,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency
" I opened up and shared something deeply upsetting to me, and you treated it as if it were nothing.",Sheldon,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency
" I, I didn’t think it was a big deal.",Penny,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency
 It is to me; that’s the point.,Sheldon,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency
" Sheldon, you are right. I’m really sorry. I should’ve known better.",Penny,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency

 Maybe tomorrow morning we put on some hot pants and see if we can score us some free omelettes.,Amy,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency
" So, hypothetically, if, if we were to have gone with them, which one would you have picked?",Bernadette,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency
 I think I would have gone with the short one with the goofy haircut.,Amy,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency
" Oh, good, ’cause I liked the tall thin one. He seemed intelligent, kind of a loner, maybe a little sexually inexperienced, like I’d have to teach him a thing or two.",Bernadette,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency
" Not my guy. I caught him staring at my rack. It’d be nice to be with a man who wants to know what’s underneath my cardigan. FYI, it’s another cardigan.",Amy,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency
 Your short sexed-up guy kind of sounds like Howard.,Bernadette,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency

 Are you hitting on me?,Davis,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency
" No, no, no, that would be crazy. I mean, if I were hitting on you, you’d know it ’cause you’d feel uncomfortable and a little sad for me.",Raj,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency
" You’re sweet. Good night, Dr. Koothrappali.",Davis,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency

 What’s the matter?,Penny,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency
" Um, well, I was worried that you might be missing Leonard. And that might be causing you to have bad dreams, like the kind you’d get if you watched Clash of the Titans right before you went to bed.",Sheldon,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency
" Sweetie, did you have a bad dream?",Penny,7.0,1.0,The Hofstadter Insufficiency

" Uh, yeah, it sounds fun, but no thanks. (Toilet flushes) Have a good night!",Penny,7.0,2.0,The Deception Verification

" Yeah, thanks, but I kind of feel like eating alone tonight, so…",Penny,7.0,2.0,The Deception Verification

 Like these swollen sausages could fit in gloves.,Howard,7.0,2.0,The Deception Verification
 This is really strong oestrogen cream. Please tell me you’ve been wearing gloves.,Bernadette,7.0,2.0,The Deception Verification
 I don’t know. Few weeks. Why?,Howard,7.0,2.0,The Deception Verification
 Let me see. How long have you been putting this on her?,Bernadette,7.0,2.0,The Deception Verification
" ‘Cause we’ve got a deeply unhealthy relationship. Which reminds me, do you think you can get any samples of this from work? This was supposed to last her a month, but they didn’t take into account the square footage of her back.",Howard,7.0,2.0,The Deception Verification
 Why can’t she do it?,Bernadette,7.0,2.0,The Deception Verification

 Then what does tweepadock mean?,Amy,7.0,2.0,The Deception Verification
" Yes, I am.",Sheldon,7.0,2.0,The Deception Verification
" Oh, and here’s a fun thing. I worked it out so that there are two different words for spoon, planko and janko. Planko is a spoon with food, janko is a spoon without food.

 It’s still gonna take a few weeks for the hormones to leave your system.,Bernadette,7.0,2.0,The Deception Verification
 Fine. I’ll wear gloves next time.,Howard,7.0,2.0,The Deception Verification
 That’s ’cause I’m a woman. I’ve had years of practice riding the dragon.,Bernadette,7.0,2.0,The Deception Verification
 You’re full of oestrogen and you don’t act like that.,Howard,7.0,2.0,The Deception Verification
" Howie, the oestrogen’s getting absorbed by your skin. That’s why you’ve been all bloated and moody and a giant pain in the ass. ",Bernadette,7.0,2.0,The Deception Verification
 Let me listen. Sounds like Leonard.,Amy,7.0,2.0,The Deception Verification
" There’s kissing in Star Trek, smarty-pants.",Sheldon,7.0,2.0,The Deception Verification

 You’re being ridiculous.,Amy,7.0,2.0,The Deception Verification
" Oh, really? She and I once had a staring contest. She clapped really loud and made me blink. It’s a small leap from there to sexual infidelity.",Sheldon,7.0,2.0,The Deception Verification
 I don’t think Penny would cheat on Leonard.,Amy,7.0,2.0,The Deception Verification
" She claimed to be alone when there was obviously someone else in her apartment. I have no choice but to assume the worst, given Leonard’s lengthy sea voyage and her famously ravenous nether regions.",Sheldon,7.0,2.0,The Deception Verification
 What?,Amy,7.0,2.0,The Deception Verification
 I fear Penny is being unfaithful to Leonard.,Sheldon,7.0,2.0,The Deception Verification

" Well, Leonard, I think it’s high time you and I address the tweepadock in the room.",Sheldon,7.0,2.0,The Deception Verification
 I actually have used those exact words before. In that order.,Leonard,7.0,2.0,The Deception Verification

" Oh, no, no, let’s not sugarcoat this. You find me finicky, pedantic and annoying.",Sheldon,7.0,2.0,The Deception Verification

" Oh, no, I should apologize. Uh, I never realized to what extent our friendship was a burden to you.",Sheldon,7.0,2.0,The Deception Verification

 Aha. ,Sheldon,7.0,2.0,The Deception Verification
" No, Sheldon, don’t.",Amy,7.0,2.0,The Deception Verification

 Leonard’s car.,Scene,7.0,3.0,The Scavenger Vortex
 Do you think Penny’s mad at me?,Leonard,7.0,3.0,The Scavenger Vortex
 Because you’re in the right lane behind a bus and you won’t go around it? I’m sure she finds it charming.,Bernadette,7.0,3.0,The Scavenger Vortex
" No, because I didn’t want her on my team.",Leonard,7.0,3.0,The Scavenger Vortex
 I’m starting to think she dodged a bullet. The slowest bullet in the world.,Bernadette,7.0,3.0,The Scavenger Vortex
" Geez, I never realized you were so competitive.",Leonard,7.0,3.0,The Scavenger Vortex
 Maybe we can do it next week.,Bernadette,7.0,3.0,The Scavenger Vortex

" I don’t think thatqualifies as a mystery, we all knew what we were doing.",Sheldon,7.0,3.0,The Scavenger Vortex

 No.,Leonard,7.0,4.0,The Raiders Minimization
 I just want to know why a five-year-old boy puts on his mom’s make-up and wears balloon boobies.,Penny,7.0,4.0,The Raiders Minimization
" They weren’t boobies, they were muscles. And the make-up was green. I was pretending to be The Hulk.",Leonard,7.0,4.0,The Raiders Minimization
 You were wearing her bra.,Penny,7.0,4.0,The Raiders Minimization
 That was to keep my muscles from sagging. Can we please stop talking about this?,Leonard,7.0,4.0,The Raiders Minimization
" Okay, okay. But you know, as a student of psychology who got a check-plus on her first homework assignment, I think, sometimes, it’s good to open up about these things.",Penny,7.0,4.0,The Raiders Minimization
" Okay, fine. Do you want to know why I dressed like The Hulk? Because I was always mad at my mom and I wanted to smash my way out of that house.",Leonard,7.0,4.0,The Raiders Minimization
" Well, why were you so angry?",Penny,7.0,4.0,The Raiders Minimization
" Gee, I don’t know. Maybe it’s because I was always the subject of her little experiments. Did you get to the chapter where she staged the Easter egg hunt with no eggs to see how long I’d keep looking? The answer, by the way, June.",Leonard,7.0,4.0,The Raiders Minimization
" Sweetie, I’m so sorry. I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better.",Penny,7.0,4.0,The Raiders Minimization

" Seriously, please find another book.",Leonard,7.0,4.0,The Raiders Minimization
" Oh, come on. Why? How bad could it be?",Penny,7.0,4.0,The Raiders Minimization
" There, there’s chapters about potty training, and bed-wetting and masturbation. Basically, if something came out of me, she wrote about it. You know what? Do whatever you want, just don’t talk to me about it.",Leonard,7.0,4.0,The Raiders Minimization
 Not even the chapter on the breast-feeding crisis?,Penny,7.0,4.0,The Raiders Minimization
" Well, when someone looks at your dating profile, the first thing they see is your picture. I just want to make sure you look fun and full of life and not like a body they just pulled out of the river. All right, here we go, and smile. Okay, uh-uh, that one’s in the bank. How about this? Turn away, and then turn back into it. But when you do, imagine the camera is the girl you want to meet.",Raj,7.0,4.0,The Raiders Minimization
 You got it.,Stuart,7.0,4.0,The Raiders Minimization

" Almost. Oh, what did you put as the one-word description of yourself?",Raj,7.0,4.0,The Raiders Minimization
" I put unobjectionable. But now that I hear it out loud, it just seems like I’m being cocky. What did you put for your best feature?",Stuart,7.0,4.0,The Raiders Minimization
" My parents’ money. Uh, what did you put for your best feature?",Raj,7.0,4.0,The Raiders Minimization
 I put: not applicable.,Stuart,7.0,4.0,The Raiders Minimization

 Really? Like what?,Stuart,7.0,4.0,The Raiders Minimization
" Hey, wait a minute. No, the Nazis were digging in the wrong place. The only reason they got the ark was because Indy found it first.",Howard,7.0,4.0,The Raiders Minimization

Personally, I think what we did to the Native Americans was wrong, but this is your favourite show, not mine. Oh, look at little Laura Ingalls, eating that peanut butter sandwich. Peanut butter? Huh? That’s strange, since peanut butter wasn’t introduced until the early 1900s. If I knew this show was about time travel, I would have watched it much sooner.",Sheldon,7.0,4.0,The Raiders Minimization

 I shouldn’t have said it. I’m sorry.,Amy,7.0,4.0,The Raiders Minimization
 Thank you.,Sheldon,7.0,4.0,The Raiders Minimization
 Do you feel better?,Amy,7.0,4.0,The Raiders Minimization

" Wait, how can, how can anyone ruin Raiders? It’s perfect.",Raj,7.0,4.0,The Raiders Minimization

 Aw!,All,7.0,4.0,The Raiders Minimization
" I enjoyed it. When you told me I was going to be losing my virginity, I didn’t think you meant showing me Raiders of the Lost Ark for the first time.",Amy,7.0,4.0,The Raiders Minimization

Here’s my jaw, drop it.",Sheldon,7.0,4.0,The Raiders Minimization

" Pants, but Leonard says sex doesn’t count.",Penny,7.0,6.0,The Romance Resonance
" Oh. You poor thing. You have one arrow in your quiver, and you just can’t use it. Fortunately, another pathway to a man’s heart is through his stomach. ",Raj,7.0,6.0,The Romance Resonance
" I don’t know if I want to cook for him. He’s kind of a picky eater. I mean, it’s too salty, it’s too dry, it’s too burnt and frozen at the same time. Okay, come on, what else would sweep you off your feet?",Penny,7.0,6.0,The Romance Resonance
" Well, I’ve always had this fantasy that involves dancing. The sexual chemistry between my partner and me is electric. But boy, oh, boy, does my father not approve until he sees us in the big dance competition.",Raj,7.0,6.0,The Romance Resonance
" Okay, that’s just the plot for Dirty Dancing. What else would you love? Other than being lifted over Patrick Swayze’s head.",Penny,7.0,6.0,The Romance Resonance

 I don’t think the Smithsonian’s gonna want your marker. ,Amy,7.0,6.0,The Romance Resonance
" And that’s why you’re not on a list for my tree fort. Ooh, guess who’s getting an article written about him in Physics Today? I’ll give you a hint. You measured the diameter of his suspicious mole yesterday.",Sheldon,7.0,6.0,The Romance Resonance
" Sheldon, I’m so proud of you.",Amy,7.0,6.0,The Romance Resonance

 That Americans can’t handle the metric system?,Amy,7.0,6.0,The Romance Resonance

 But the Chinese team found the element.,Amy,7.0,6.0,The Romance Resonance

 So you just got lucky?,Amy,7.0,6.0,The Romance Resonance
 Sheldon Cooper does not get lucky.,Sheldon,7.0,6.0,The Romance Resonance

" What matters is the greatest scientific achievement of my life is based on a blunder. I’m not a genius, I’m a fraud.",Sheldon,7.0,6.0,The Romance Resonance

" Oh, people get things they don’t deserve all the time. Look at me with you. ",Leonard,7.0,6.0,The Romance Resonance
" No, Leonard, this is going to haunt me for the rest of my life. Every science classroom, every periodic table, every textbook, this mistake will be staring back at me. Like that time you let Koothrappali wax your eyebrows. I’ve got to find a way to stop this thing.",Sheldon,7.0,6.0,The Romance Resonance
" Buddy, I don’t think you can. I mean, once it’s out there, it’s out there. This thing is like the science equivalent of a sex tape.",Leonard,7.0,6.0,The Romance Resonance

 Woo!,Voice,7.0,6.0,The Romance Resonance
" And no woos. Oh, not you, Dr. Woo. You’re fine. I want you all to know that you have no reason to applaud me. My so-called breakthrough wasn’t the result of my genius.

 You’re not?,Sheldon,7.0,6.0,The Romance Resonance

" No, no, now that we’ve cleared the air, I wanted to discuss another matter with you.",Sheldon,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
" Sheldon, in a couple hours I have to get up, pee and then wander around the house.",Arthur,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
" Well, then, I’ll make this quick. Um, I want to talk about the paper you sent Leonard. Now, I know he said it’s promising and he’s going to collaborate on it, but now that you and I are friends again, I am at your disposal. And, um, frankly, lending my name and reputation to it will help, because a lot of people think that you’re a washed-up has-been. Or dead.",Sheldon,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
 I should be so lucky.,Arthur,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
" So, uh, what do you say?",Sheldon,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
" Yeah, but only because I was dating a second grader.",Penny,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
" Hello, everyone.",Howard,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
" Okay, let me have it. Let’s hear all the Raj is a girl jokes.",Raj,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
 Nope. Bernadette told me it isn’t nice and I’m not allowed.,Howard,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
 Thank you.,Raj,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
" So I won’t be making fun of you, or the things you like, or the fact that you just want to have fu-un.",Howard,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
" Howie, stop. Come on, look at what I’m making.",Bernadette,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
" Oh, that’s actually pretty nice.",Howard,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
 I’m making a bracelet.,Amy,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
" Yeah, I’m just making a mess.",Penny,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
" Hello, Leonard. Oh, hello, Arthur. What an odd coincidence that you’re both here.",Sheldon,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
 Why is it odd?,Leonard,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
" Because as it just so happens, I’m also spending the day with a beloved children’s television science personality. Isn’t that right, new friend and colleague Bill Nye the Science Guy. Sorry, I replaced you with a newer model.",Sheldon,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
" Wow, Arthur Jeffries. It’s an honour to meet you. My show never would have happened without yours.",Nye,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
 That’s what I told my lawyers.,Arthur,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement

" Well, I would have been here sooner, but for some reason your home isn’t on this map of Hollywood stars.",Sheldon,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
" What do you want, Sheldon?",Arthur,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
 It’s been pointed out by my girlfriend that I may have been annoying to you.,Sheldon,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
 She sounds like a keeper.,Arthur,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
" Anyway, I wanted to apologize. I am truly sorry.",Sheldon,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
 What are you working on?,Amy,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
" Ah, I’m making a necklace for my mom. ",Raj,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
 That’s sweet.,Amy,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
" Yeah, she and my dad are going through a bit of a rough patch, so I wanted to do something to let her know I was thinking about her.",Raj,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
 What’s going on with them?,Penny,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
 They’re just having a little trouble communicating. My dad says it’s because the sound of my mom’s voice makes him want to tear his ears off and sew them over his eyes so he never has to look at her again.,Raj,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
" You know, if it’s all the same with you, I, I think I’ll, I’ll stick with Leonard.",Arthur,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
" It’s because I’m annoying, right? I know it is. Say it. Say it. Say I’m annoying. ",Sheldon,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
 Good night.,Arthur,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement

" I’m sorry, Dr. Jeffries, I’m just excited. This nano vacuum tube idea of yours is, it’s really interesting.",Leonard,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
" Everything we need to make jewellery moulds. Here’s some silver, a crucible and an acetylene torch to melt it down.",Howard,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
" Ooh, that looks like fun.",Penny,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
 Maybe you should master glue before you move on to fire.,Bernadette,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
" Okay, who’s up first?",Howard,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
" Rajesh, do you want to make a bracelet for your mom to go with the necklace?",Amy,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
" No, thanks.",Raj,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
 He said I’d be speaking to a class.,Bill,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement

 Yeah.,Arthur,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement

 Sorry we’re late. I wanted to swing by the lab and pick up some even cooler tools for us to use.,Howard,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
 I didn’t know you were coming again.,Raj,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
" Well, last week was a blast. Plus, I thought you might like having a guy here. ",Howard,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
 It was not funny.,(laughing),7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
" So, what tools did you bring?",Amy,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement

 My name is Howard. I can make your hair into diamonds. My mom is morbidly obese. Everybody love me.,Raj,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement

" Hi, Sheldon.",Arthur,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
 I’m surprised to see you here.,Sheldon,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement

 I’ll get Leonard.,Sheldon,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement

 Since when can’t you open up with me?,Howard,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement

 Thank you. It would be an honour.,Sheldon,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
" Oh. Uh, great.",Arthur,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement

" Well, first, I think the fact that you use your birthday as a password is embarrassing. ",Sheldon,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement

 Is it really worth getting upset about?,Amy,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement
" Yeah, they say don’t meet your heroes. Don’t peek behind that curtain of fame and celebrity, because if you do, you’ll see them as they really are, degenerate carnival folk.",Sheldon,7.0,7.0,The Proton Displacement

" Okay, Sheldon, I know I was supposed to return this DVD a long time ago, and I know we rented it on your card. But it’s been, like, seven years and clearly nothing bad has happened. So in-in-in-instead of being a giant pain in the ass like you always are, what if this one time you just tried staying calm?",Leonard,7.0,8.0,The Itchy Brain Simulation
" That seems like a reasonable request. Although so did, hey, Leonard, would you mind returning that DVD?",Sheldon,7.0,8.0,The Itchy Brain Simulation

" Yeah, I get that. I’ll go get you your water. When you say easier, you mean easier for you, right? ‘Cause it certainly didn’t make it easier for him.",Penny,7.0,8.0,The Itchy Brain Simulation
 Any chance I can get a different waitress?,Lucy,7.0,8.0,The Itchy Brain Simulation
" I’m sorry, this is rude of me. I will go get that water. See, see, see, see. Just now you expressed your feelings to my face. How come you could do that with me, but not Raj?",Penny,7.0,8.0,The Itchy Brain Simulation
 Oh. I forgot about this. My aunt made it for me when I started college.,Leonard,7.0,8.0,The Itchy Brain Simulation

" No, no, no, I, I looked, and there’s, there’s, there’s no more tickets.",Leonard,7.0,8.0,The Itchy Brain Simulation

" Okay, okay. I’m gonna show you what’s in the box. But just promise not to flip out.",Leonard,7.0,8.0,The Itchy Brain Simulation
 I scraped gum off the bottom of that table. Only ’cause my manager saw me put it there.,Penny,7.0,8.0,The Itchy Brain Simulation
 It’s called proving a point.,Leonard,7.0,8.0,The Itchy Brain Simulation
 Is the point that you’re an idiot?,Howard,7.0,8.0,The Itchy Brain Simulation
" Gentlemen, please. Leonard is trying to walk a mile in my metaphorical shoes. He can’t walk in my actual shoes. He has the feet of a toddler.",Sheldon,7.0,8.0,The Itchy Brain Simulation
" So, how are you gonna return the DVD if the store went out of business?",Raj,7.0,8.0,The Itchy Brain Simulation
" Monday morning I’ll go downtown, look up the owner’s information and send him the DVD. Pay the late fee, and prove to Sheldon that you can have a problem and solve it without acting like a complete lunatic. Ah!",Leonard,7.0,8.0,The Itchy Brain Simulation
 And the man impersonating a bear would like everyone to know that only you can prevent forest fires.,Howard,7.0,8.0,The Itchy Brain Simulation
 I believe you.,Sheldon,7.0,8.0,The Itchy Brain Simulation
 And you’re going to stay calm?,Leonard,7.0,8.0,The Itchy Brain Simulation
 I said I would.,Sheldon,7.0,8.0,The Itchy Brain Simulation

 The apartment.,Scene,7.0,8.0,The Itchy Brain Simulation
" So, when you say you’re not going to freak out about the DVD, here’s what that means. Don’t fixate on it. Don’t wake me up in the middle of the night. Or nag me through the door while I’m on the toilet.",Leonard,7.0,8.0,The Itchy Brain Simulation
" Okay, first, talking to you while you’re on the toilet isn’t exactly a picnic for me either, okay? Remember, when you can hear me, I can hear you. And second, you completely disregard how uncomfortable unresolved issues are for me. It’s, it’s like, a, an itch in my brain I can’t scratch.",Sheldon,7.0,8.0,The Itchy Brain Simulation
 When I broke my arm I used to stick a coat hanger down there. You ever try that? Maybe go in through the ear?,Leonard,7.0,8.0,The Itchy Brain Simulation

 You want to say sorry.,Amy,7.0,8.0,The Itchy Brain Simulation
" So, how are you gonna tell Raj abut what you did?",Bernadette,7.0,8.0,The Itchy Brain Simulation
 What do you mean how? What’s the big deal?,Penny,7.0,8.0,The Itchy Brain Simulation
 You told Lucy he was a pathetic mess.,Amy,7.0,8.0,The Itchy Brain Simulation
 Then you made her cry and leave.,Bernadette,7.0,8.0,The Itchy Brain Simulation
" You got it. If this sweater shuts you up, I’m gonna make a fortune selling them to everyone we know. Now all I need to do is head down to the video store and return the DVD.",Leonard,7.0,8.0,The Itchy Brain Simulation

I lit a candle and prayed for your death but I’m not Armenian, so it probably won’t work. This is over, right?",Leonard,7.0,8.0,The Itchy Brain Simulation

" These things happen all the time, Sheldon.",Leonard,7.0,10.0,The Discovery Dissipation

" Okay, Barry, that’s enough.",Leonard,7.0,10.0,The Discovery Dissipation

 Doesn’t matter. This is no way to make new humans. People coming out of people. It’s some kind of dirty magic show.,Sheldon,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 Sheldon Lee Cooper. You get back in this room right now. And bring a mop.,(off),7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 Did you hear that? A mop. I have two PhDs yet somehow I’m the janitor of my sister’s birth canal.,Sheldon,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction

 We do?,Penny,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction

 Hello.,Sheldon,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 Doing laundry?,Penny,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" Of course I’m doing laundry. Saturday night is laundry night, and I’m in a laundry room, so, I believe your inference is justified.",Sheldon,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction

" Well, things would be a little different.",Howard,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" Howard, where’s my lunch? I’m starving.",(off),7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction

 Aw.,Penny,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 Yay.,Amy,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 Congrats.,Raj,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" Oh, thank you. I wasn’t sure I was gonna to make it. But my mother gave me some ice chips, my sister told me to breathe, and I just thought to myself, Sheldon, if you can make it through the Green Lantern movie, you can make it through this.",Sheldon,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" Well, good for you, buddy. We’ll let you get back in there.",Leonard,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction

 Coming.,Leonard,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 Hang on. Why would I be fat?,Leonard,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" If that were true, I wouldn’t still be living alone. Well, not exactly alone. I do have a 50 pound sack of rice with one of Sheldon’s T-shirts on it.",Amy,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" I’m telling you, Sheldon cares for you more than you think.",Leonard,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 I wish I could believe you. I also wish there wasn’t a mouse living in Rice Sheldon.,Amy,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" Hang on, I’m gonna give you a little early Christmas present. I’m gonna show you something, but if you ever told Sheldon he’d probably never speak to me again. So, if you want to tell him, that’s fine. Look.",Leonard,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 I don’t understand.,Amy,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 He made you his screensaver.,Leonard,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" Oh. Wow. I had no idea. He is so into me. Wait, wait, where’d I go?",Amy,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" Oh, well, it’s you, Swamp Thing, Stephen Hawking, Spider-Man, but, look, you’re in the mix.",Leonard,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 I am in the mix. And I’m the hottest one.,Amy,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 Who’s that?,Penny,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" Oh, Madame Curie.",Leonard,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" That’s fine, she’s dead.",Amy,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" It’s hard to say, my life would be so different.",Amy,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 You can say better. Sheldon can’t hear you.,Howard,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 I don’t know.,Amy,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me, there’s tears in the frosting, happy birthday to me. (Stuart honks a party hooter at her.)",Amy,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 I missed you.,Amy,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" To quote Han Solo, I know.",Sheldon,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 Did you miss me?,Amy,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 I would’ve preferred to have you there with me.,Sheldon,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 Oh.,Amy,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 Or instead of me.,Sheldon,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 Did you hold the baby?,Amy,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 I did. ,Sheldon,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 And? How did it make you feel?,Amy,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" Looking into the blank, innocent eyes of a creature that couldn’t begin to comprehend anything I was saying? Basically just another day at the office.",Sheldon,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 I’m gonna do it. I’m gonna ask her out.,Leonard,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 And chocolate milk is gonna squirt out of my nipples.,Howard,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" Well, you always complain that you never had an intelligent role model growing up, and now you can be one for your nephew.",Amy,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" Ugh, all right, I’ll go. But from what I’ve seen, his attention span is as limited as his bladder control.",Sheldon,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 You actually got him to do it.,Bernadette,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" Yeah, you keep saying how much Sheldon has affected all of us, but you’ve clearly had an impact on him.",Rajj,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" Wait, so Star Wars and Star Trek characters can go on the same branch?",Raj,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" I know, it’s crazy. Welcome to the Thunderdome, people. (All whoop)",Leonard,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 I’ve never done this before. It’s kind of fun.,Howard,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" Yeah, if your mom could see her little Bar Mitzvah boy right now, she’d have a heart attack.",Raj,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" Good idea, I’ll take a picture.",Bernadette,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" Honey, I’m a little strapped for cash this year, so for Christmas I was thinking of giving you this.",Penny,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 I love it.,Leonard,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 Okay.,Penny,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 But it is what you got me last year.,Leonard,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 Yeah.,Penny,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 And last night.,Leonard,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 Hello.,Stuart,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction

 Is someone sick?,Leonard,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction

 The stairwell.,Scene,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 You okay?,Sheldon,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 Just really glad you’re back.,Amy,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" Me, too. I got a lot of TV to catch up on.",Sheldon,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 Yes. My sister’s uterus came down with a baby.,Sheldon,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" Oh, she’s pregnant? That’s great. You’re gone an uncle. Uncle Sheldon.",Penny,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" No, I will be Uncle Dr. Cooper.",Sheldon,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 How come you never said she was pregnant?,Amy,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" Well, I never told you about my brother’s kidney stone. You want to hear about everything that comes out of my family’s genitals?",Sheldon,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" Well, congrats, and it’s nice you’re gonna be there for your sister.",Leonard,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 Yes. I’m filling in for her husband who’s recovering from a horrible motorcycle accident. Lucky duck.,Sheldon,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" Wow, so, how long will you be gone?",Penny,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" Well, she’s due tomorrow. Although it did take her six years to finish high school, so who knows?",Sheldon,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 Can I give you a ride to the airport?,Amy,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" Oh, no, thank you, I don’t want to be an inconvenience. Chop-chop, Leonard. We leave in ten minutes.",Sheldon,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 The apartment.,Scene,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction

" Wow, you’re really good at this.",Penny,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" Well, I have an extremely low centre of gravity. I’m like a pyramid.",Amy,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
 How you doing over there?,Penny,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" Oh, I hope it’s just a sprain. I cannot walk into that E.R. with another video game injury.",Leonard,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" Hey, Sheldon, you want to play next?",Penny,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" Oh, I would, but I’m on my way out.",Sheldon,7.0,11.0,The Cooper Extraction
" Ooh, Mark Harmon, he’s a dreamboat.",Raj,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
" So it, it’s just flirting?",Leonard,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
" Well, yeah. Why?",Penny,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
" Uh, no reason. I just think it’s sexier when things are left to the imagination.",Leonard,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
 He’s wrong.,Amy,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
 The Cheesecake Factory.,Scene,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
 So I read a study that says a man with a dog is three times more likely to get a woman’s phone number.,Raj,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
 Is it true even when the man lets his dog lick peanut butter off his tongue?,Leonard,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
 I don’t see why not. ,Raj,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
 The apartment.,Scene,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
" This is nice, that we all get to eat together.",Amy,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
" Oh, that’s so sweet of you, but I was gonna steal food from here. You know, my treat.",Penny,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
" Wait, if Howard’s mother is coming, then you should also steal marbles. Because she’s obese, and hippos are obese, and in the popular board game Hungry Hungry Hippos, they eat marbles. Maybe I need to dumb these down for you. ",Sheldon,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
" Well, Stuart’s cute in his own way.",Bernadette,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
" When I was a baby, my mother called me her little possum.",Stuart,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
 Are possums cute?,Raj,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
 Not at all.,Stuart,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
" If you’re so intimidated by talking to attractive girls, maybe you should practice by talking to regular people.",Howard,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
 You mean like fatties and uggos?,Raj,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
 Or maybe just stop talking.,Bernadette,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
" If you’re really desperate to meet women and like having food eaten out of your mouth, I could set you up with my mom.",Howard,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
 Why is that funny? That’s just unhygienic.,Sheldon,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
 It’s a joke.,Leonard,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
" I don’t think so. I believe that a joke is a brief oral narrative with a climactic humorous twist. For example, uh, Wolowitz’s mother is so fat that she decided to go on a diet, or exercise, or both. See? The twist is that people don’t usually change. Well, they don’t.",Sheldon,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
" Hey, guys, don’t forget, my episode’s on TV tomorrow night.",Penny,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
 We’ll be there.,Howard,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
 Can we bring anything?,Raj,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
" I know, but you’re going to be a TV star and you haven’t left me yet. That takes guts.",Leonard,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
" I don’t know about you, but I’m very uncomfortable with all this.",Sheldon,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
 Why?,Amy,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
 I’ve never seen this show before and now I’m starting with episode 246? It’s unnatural.,Sheldon,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
 Just think of the first 245 as the prequel.,Amy,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
 All right.,Sheldon,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
" Okay, shh, guys, guys, this is it.",Penny,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification

" You know, I think we’re zeroing in on your problem.",Leonard,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
" Perhaps I’ll spend some time developing a unified theory of comedy, which will allow me to elicit laughter from anyone at any time. Unless they’re German, ’cause that’s a tough crowd.",Sheldon,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
 Are you set on people laughing with you? ‘Cause if you’re cool with at you…,Leonard,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification

" No, there was supposed to be a big scene with me and Mark Harmon, but it’s gone.",Penny,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
 What happened?,Bernadette,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
 They must’ve cut it.,Penny,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
" Oh, Penny, I’m, I’m sorry. ",Leonard,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
 That stinks.,Howard,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
 I’m sure you were great.,Raj,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
" This doesn’t make any sense. I mean, I, I thought I did a, a really good job, I… Excuse me.",Penny,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
 I’ve been studying how to make people laugh. They say that comedy is tragedy plus time. Let’s tickle some ribs.,Sheldon,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification

 Unbelievable.,Penny,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
" Oh, come on, no, that’s not what I meant.",Leonard,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
 Then what did you mean?,Penny,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
" I don’t, look, you know, words don’t always have to mean things.",Leonard,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
 I think you meant that you don’t believe in me.,Penny,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification

" No, please. Don’t stop, go on. Tell me how I’m gonna be a waitress for the rest of my life.",Penny,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification
" That is not what I said. Look, I think you’re really good. I truly do. But this is an incredibly hard thing that you’re shooting for. I mean, the odds of anyone becoming a successful actor are like a million to one.",Leonard,7.0,12.0,The Hesitation Ramification

" Anyway, I got invited to do a little talk at NASA in Houston this weekend. They gave me two tickets. Bernadette can’t go. You want to come with me? You can visit your mom, and I’ll show you around the space centre.",Howard,7.0,17.0,The Friendship Turbulence
 I think we’re gonna go.,Amy,7.0,17.0,The Friendship Turbulence

" Hey, I work at the same university you do.",Howard,7.0,17.0,The Friendship Turbulence

 I think we’re gonna go.,Amy,7.0,17.0,The Friendship Turbulence

 Thanks for walking me to my car.,Amy,7.0,17.0,The Friendship Turbulence
 The street,Scene,7.0,17.0,The Friendship Turbulence

 I was there. It was funny.,Raj,7.0,17.0,The Friendship Turbulence
 The lecture was on cosmic gas clouds. That’s funny.,Howard,7.0,17.0,The Friendship Turbulence

" Yeah, I know it’s on, Sheldon. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I cannot afford this right now.",Penny,7.0,17.0,The Friendship Turbulence
" That’s a great idea. And in the spirit of our new arrangement, I will mask my surprise that you came up with it.",Sheldon,7.0,17.0,The Friendship Turbulence
" Uh, for starters, we could stop insulting each other.",Howard,7.0,17.0,The Friendship Turbulence
 Very well. How do you propose we move forward?,Sheldon,7.0,17.0,The Friendship Turbulence

" Well, what would I say to her?",Amy,7.0,17.0,The Friendship Turbulence

Now that girl’s gonna get discovered and become famous and go on Letterman and talk about how she got her big break on a cheap monkey movie all because some dumb girl thought it was beneath her.,Penny,7.0,17.0,The Friendship Turbulence
" I’m so sorry. I know it’s a sensitive subject, but can you reconsider that part in the movie?",Leonard,7.0,17.0,The Friendship Turbulence

" What is that, like, the Indian Sherlock Holmes?",Bernadette,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Or is Sherlock Holmes the English Byomkesh Bakshi?,Raj,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" According to Wikipedia, Sherlock Holmes came first.",Amy,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Great, everyone’s a Byomkesh Bakshi. Now, here are some secret facts about each of you, including whether you are the murderer. Throughout the game, feel free to ask each other questions to uncover clues.",Raj,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Got it. Hey, who’s the murderer?",Penny,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Any question but that.,Raj,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Sorry. Hey, who’s not the murderer?",Penny,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Bernadette, can you not stand so close to me?",Stuart,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Well, it’s too late.",Raj,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 What do you mean it’s too late?,Leonard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 He’s been murdered by someone in this room.,Raj,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Oh, my God.",Penny,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Oh, come on.",Leonard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 It wasn’t easy. Was it Buzz?,Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 We can’t show up to your mom’s empty-handed. We should bring something.,Howard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 I already am. I’m bringing the gift of knowledge.,Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Oh, boy.",Howard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Despite what her Bible says, recent archaeological studies indicate that although camels are referenced in the Old Testament, they didn’t exist in the Middle East until hundreds of years later.",Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 I was gonna say we pick up a cake or a pie. But an insult to her faith is always thoughtful.,Howard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 The apartment. ,Scene,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" So, what happens next?",Bernadette,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 I can’t tell you that. But perhaps the killer dropped a fun and imaginative clue somewhere in the apartment.,Raj,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Ooh, I’m gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer.",Penny,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Hey, I found something. It looks like a little man with a briefcase.",Amy,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Thank you.,Raj,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 That kind of actress. This sucks.,Penny,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Come on, guys. Raj put a lot of effort into this. And that’s great. It’s not sad, it’s great.",Leonard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 I think it might be fun to be someone else tonight.,Amy,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Actually, you’re all just gonna be yourselves.",Raj,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Yeah, I was. I was 200 pounds by the time I was in middle school. Kids were mean. Cows may be sacred there, but it doesn’t help if you look like one. Anyway, I was pretty lonely, so I had to make up my own stories and games, and I promised myself if I ever made any friends that, that I would play those games with them.",Raj,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 That is so sweet.,Amy,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 I’ve seen old pictures of you. You were never a fat kid.,Leonard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" No, I was svelte as a gazelle. A gazelle blessed with a flair for storytelling.",Raj,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Hey, what about this? It looks like a receipt.",Bernadette,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 What’s it for?,Amy,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 For a cup of coffee. But it’s dated 20 years from now.,Bernadette,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 From the future? How fun and imaginative.,Raj,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 So one of us came back from the future to murder Stuart?,Leonard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Correct.,Raj,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Does the gazelle with a flair for storytelling know he’s just ripping off Terminator?,Leonard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 What do you care? You’re dead.,Bernadette,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Suit yourself. But I can kind of see up your skirt.,Stuart,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 A hire car.,Scene,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Thank you for my bobble head.,Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Thank you for not making fun of me during my speech.,Howard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" But if we show up and you’re holding them, she’ll think they’re only from you.",Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 They are only from me. You said the gift of you was enough.,Howard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Yes, but now that I’ve seen what the gift of me with flowers and pie looks like, there’s no going back. Boy, I can’t wait to see the look on her face. We’re leaving right now.",Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 What’s wrong?,Howard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Nothing.,Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" What? Sheldon, tell me what’s going on.",Howard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 I saw my mommy with a naked man and she was trying to be a mommy again.,Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 A bar in Texas.,Scene,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 You ready to talk about it?,Howard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 I’m not nearly drunk enough. Okay. Do you have any idea what it’s like to see your mother ravaging someone?,Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Does a brisket count? I’m sorry, buddy, that’s rough. But didn’t she know we were coming?",Howard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Oh, no, no. That’s Clarence Darrow. It’s from a game Sheldon made up called Chutes and Lawyers. You slide down a chute and then work your way back up through the appellate system.",Leonard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Well, unlike that, my games are much more fun.",Raj,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Okay, can I ask you something? Why do you like making us do this stuff?",Penny,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Well, I guess it goes back to when I was a fat kid in India, and didn’t have any friends.",Raj,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 I didn’t know you were fat.,Bernadette,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Well, don’t do it on the phone.",Howard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" No, I’m just going to tell her I’m coming so she can give that good time Charlie the heave-ho.",Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" That’s some tough talk, I may need to cut you off.",Howard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Yeah, maybe you better, I took a pretty big sip.",Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Look, she’s a grown woman. And, and your dad’s been gone a long time. Maybe this is none of your business.",Howard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" I beg to differ. I used to live in those genitals. And if someone wants to move into my old room, I should at least get a vote.",Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 The apartment.,Scene,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Okay, murder suspects, Leonard has found the time machine the killer must’ve used. You’re all inside it, and we hurtle through the very fabric of time. And welcome to 20 years in the future. Hey, you guys just time-travelled. Stop looking so bored.",Raj,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Well, my beer isn’t flat and my rack’s not saggy. So far, the future’s great.",Penny,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Hey, can I go to the bathroom?",Stuart,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Fine, just try not to look too alive.",Raj,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Does the smart-ass know that Terminator was actually ripped off from an Outer Limits script called Demon With a Glass Hand, by Harlan Ellison?",Raj,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Oh, does the gazelle know that according to Harlan Ellison, it was not ripped off from Demon With a Glass Hand, but was ripped off from another Outer Limits script he wrote called The Soldier?",Leonard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 I’m gonna need another clue.,Penny,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Sheldon’s childhood home.,Scene,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Okay, give me the flowers and pie.",Howard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Hey, I’m a famous actress living in London.",Penny,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Hmm, I’m a professor at Stanford.",Leonard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Hmm.,Penny,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 So I guess you two are making it work long distance.,Bernadette,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Oh, no. In this game, as your careers both took off, you drifted apart. Kind of like how future me lost touch with you guys after I became boy toy for the wrinkled, but still flexible, Madonna.",Raj,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" What does your card say, Bernadette?",Amy,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Uh, uh, uh, hang on. Do you think we’d really drift apart if we both became successful?",Leonard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Of course not. If I became a famous actress and had to move, you would just come with me.",Penny,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" But if I get a chance to be a tenured professor, I might not have that much choice in where I end up.",Leonard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Yeah, but if I become a successful actress, we wouldn’t need the money.",Penny,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Well, you don’t go into science for the money.",Leonard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 No. I wanted to surprise her. What am I supposed to say to her after something like this?,Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Well, did she see you in the window?",Howard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 No.,Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Then don’t say anything.,Howard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" I have to. How can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship if I don’t tell her how disappointed I am, and that I’ll never forgive her?",Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Really? You think I’m putting this body through three kids?,Penny,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Sheldon’s childhood home.,Scene,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Okay, let’s do this.",Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Good luck.,Howard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" You, aren’t you gonna come with me?",Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 While you confront your mother about her sex life? I’d rather go back to that bar in ass-less chaps.,Howard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" (Knock, knock, knock) Mother? (Knock, knock, knock) Mother? (Knock, knock, knock) Mother?",Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Shelly, I’m so glad you’re here.",Cooper,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 I saw you having naked sex.,Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 What are you talking about?,Cooper,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Earlier, I came here to surprise you. I looked in the window and I saw you with a man.",Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 That’s my jam.,Stuart,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 So one of us went back in time to kill Stuart?,Bernadette,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 But why?,Amy,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Perhaps this will help. Here are some facts about yourselves in the future that might contain a clue.,Raj,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Hey, I won the Nobel Prize in physiology, then I used the money to buy Stuart’s comic book store, and close it down so Sheldon would pay attention to me. Not the worst idea.",Amy,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 How long have you been involved with him?,Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 A few months.,Cooper,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" And of those few months, how long have you been a demented sex pervert?",Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 That is no way to speak to your mother.,Cooper,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Perhaps not. But it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the Bible to me my whole life, and then desecrates one of Ethan Allen’s finest sofas.",Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" I will give you one opportunity, young man, to apologize.",Cooper,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Or what?,Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Or I will send you to your room.,Cooper,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 That’s ridiculous. I am a grown man. I am a professional scientist. And I currently occupy the moral high ground.,Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Go to your room.,Cooper,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 But I occupy the moral high ground.,Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Speak for yourself. Last month, my company both invented and cured Restless Eye Syndrome. Ka-ching, ya blinky chumps.",Bernadette,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" So, wait, if my career took me somewhere else, you might not go?",Penny,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Dun, dun, dun. He started it.",Amy,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Okay, okay, guys, new back stories. Uh, Penny and Leonard, you two lovebirds are super successful and living in New York. Uh, you’re an actress, you’re a professor and you have three beautiful kids.",Raj,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Great.,Leonard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Can we please get back to the game?,Raj,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 In a minute. I don’t understand why any success you have in acting is more important than any I have in science.,Leonard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Okay, if you do something cool in science, you might change the world. If I become a famous actress, I’m not gonna tell you why movie stars are the best. They just are.",Penny,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 I’m surprised you guys never talked about this stuff.,Amy,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Like you and Sheldon have everything figured out?,Leonard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Actually, our relationship agreement covers a wide array of scenarios, including career changes, financial instability, intelligent dog uprising. FYI, we plan on selling out the human race hard.",Amy,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" In 20 years, who knows what’ll happen with any of us?",Penny,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 I think you and Leonard will be together.,Stuart,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 You do?,Penny,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Yeah. I think you’re the best couple I know.,Stuart,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Aw.,Leonard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Oh, Shelly, I’m so sorry. Come in. Um, maybe we should sit down and talk about this.",Cooper,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Can you recommend a surface you haven’t had coitus on?,Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" That’s not funny. Maybe we should sit at the table. Well, I’m sure that, uh, you have a lot of questions.",Cooper,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Who was he?,Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 His name is Ron. I met him at my prayer group.,Cooper,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Aw, Stuart. Now I feel bad for murdering you.",Penny,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Oh, come on.",Raj,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Penny did it, I win. Suck it, jackasses.",Bernadette,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Sheldon’s old bedroom.,Scene,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Hey, can I come in?",Howard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Apparently any man is welcome in this house. Why not you? I thought you were waiting in the car.,Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" That was an hour ago, Sheldon. A Jew sits in front of a house in Texas that long, For Sale signs start to go up. I take it things didn’t go smoothly with your mom.",Howard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 No. I’m not sure how we’re going to get past this.,Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" You know, I, I sort of went through something like this myself.",Howard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Howard, we’ve all seen your mother naked. That woman needs to learn how to tie a robe.",Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 I’m talking about when my mom started seeing someone a couple of years after my dad left.,Howard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Go to your room.,Cooper,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 But I’m a professional scientist.,Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation

 The apartment.,Scene,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 All I’m saying is you might not want to get in the way of your mom’s happiness.,Howard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation

" Shelly, I’m sorry that you saw what you saw. I know that this is hard for you.",Cooper,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" I think what most upsets me about it, Mother, is the hypocrisy. Doesn’t this contradict all the religious rules you’ve been espousing your whole life?",Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" You’re right, it does, and it’s something that I’m struggling with these days.",Cooper,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Then why are you doing it?,Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 That’s so sweet.,Penny,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 What the hell?,Bernadette,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Excuse me?,Amy,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Ah-da-da-da-da, let the dead man talk. So, why do you think that?",Penny,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Uh, well, I feel like you guys make each other better. Penny brought Leonard out of his shell. And it seems like Leonard makes Penny think more deeply about the world. I don’t know. Together, you two kind of make one awesome person.",Stuart,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 The apartment.,Scene,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Should you really be sitting in Sheldon’s spot?,Amy,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" He’s in Texas, he’ll never know.",Raj,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 I wouldn’t be so sure about that.,Penny,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Yeah, he has a very sensitive butt. Well, it’s true. Once I saw him sit on a bunch of loose change and add it up.",Leonard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Have you heard from Howard?,Raj,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 I did. His talk at NASA went great.,Bernadette,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation

" Hey, guys.",Stuart,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Are you having the sex talk with me?,Cooper,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Well, someone has to.",Sheldon,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Aw.,Bernadette,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation

 Definitely.,Penny,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Well, I hope 20 years from now, we really are all still together and still friends.",Bernadette,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 It was. By Terminator.,Leonard,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Thank you. I thought it was inspired.,Raj,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 I liked the time travel element.,Bernadette,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
" Oh, dear Lord.",Cooper,7.0,18.0,The Mommy Observation
 Now I think you’re flirting with the line. Good news?,Amy,7.0,19.0,The Indecision Amalgamation
 Am I a terrible person that it crossed my mind that she might die and never see the card?,Bernadette,7.0,19.0,The Indecision Amalgamation
" No. No, it was a mistake.",Amy,7.0,19.0,The Indecision Amalgamation
 Am I a terrible person?,Bernadette,7.0,19.0,The Indecision Amalgamation

 I’m liking my odds here.,Penny,7.0,19.0,The Indecision Amalgamation

 I don’t know what to do.,Penny,7.0,19.0,The Indecision Amalgamation

 Why would they still be using DDR3? Are they nuts?,Amy,7.0,19.0,The Indecision Amalgamation

 Included?,Amy,7.0,19.0,The Indecision Amalgamation
" No, see? Well, you absolutely would not. And furthermore, the Xbox One now comes with a Kinect included.",Sheldon,7.0,19.0,The Indecision Amalgamation
" Well, you wouldn’t want your gaming system to overheat.",Amy,7.0,19.0,The Indecision Amalgamation

 Do you want me to go to the funeral with you?,Amy,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Oh, I’m not going to the funeral.",Sheldon,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Why not?,Amy,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" All those people blowing their noses. You can’t tell the sick from the sad. Mm. I’ll be at home celebrating Star Wars Day, as planned.",Sheldon,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Are you sure you don’t want to go say good-bye?,Amy,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 I have a confession to make.,Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Hmm?,Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 I’ve never been to a funeral before.,Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Really?,Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Hey, guys.",Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Hey, Penny. Happy Star Wars Day.",Raj,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Okay.,Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Can I make you breakfast? Admiral Ackbar’s Snack Bar is open for business.,Raj,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" No, thanks. Leonard and I are just going to the funeral.",Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 You sure. Not even coffee? We have R2-Decaf. Maybe a nice Cafe Au Leia?,Howard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 And if you’re not in the mood for coffee I can always make you a Chai Tea-3PO.,Raj,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Oh, I get it, like C3PO. What happened to me?",Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Hey, uh, Sheldon, you want anything?",Raj,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Uh, no, thank you.",Sheldon,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 You’re being so quiet. Are you upset or are you just rebooting?,Howard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 I’m fine.,Sheldon,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 It was a gift. Thank you for being the emotional one in this relationship.,Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 I got your back.,Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Yeah.,Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 The apartment. ,Scene,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" He was 84, he’d say where’s my pudding?",Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Before you go, at least let me pack you some Attack of the Scones for the road.",Raj,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Oh, like Attack of the Clones. We are leaving right now.",Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Amy”s apartment. ,Scene,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Arthur passing away was harder on Sheldon than he’s ready to admit. Really hoping this will cheer him up.,Amy,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Me, too. Although, it might’ve been thoughtless of us to bake a Death Star cake.",Bernadette,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" No, it combines two of Sheldon’s favorite things, chocolate chips and the ability to destroy a planet at the push of a button.",Amy,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Well, anyway, it’ll be a nice surprise for the boys. And Howie doesn’t think I take his interests seriously, so hopefully this will keep him fooled for a while.",Bernadette,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Okay, let’s get the fondant and start decorating.",Amy,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 This is pretty cool. You don’t see too many spherical cakes.,Bernadette,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 I wonder why that is.,Amy,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 The funeral.,Scene,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Or should we respect his privacy in this moment of grief?,Howard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 By staying here and watching the movie.,Raj,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 That’s what good friends would do.,Howard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Later.,Scene,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" I just never knew anyone that died. I had a pet pig when I was a kid. I mean, when he died, we didn’t have a funeral, we had a barbecue.",Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Yeah, we won’t be eating Arthur tonight.",Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" I didn’t know him very well, but I still really liked him. It’s weird that he’s just gone.",Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 I know.,Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 I feel like I want to cry.,Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Oh that’s, that’s fine. Go ahead.",Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 I can’t do it with you staring at me.,Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Sorry.,Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" No, I’m dry. You’re a big crybaby, you start, I’ll join in.",Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 I am not a crybaby.,Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Toy Story 3?,Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" The toys were holding hands in a furnace. Look, Arthur lived a full life. And he inspired a lot of people. Sure, he, he was my childhood hero, but the fact that I got to work with him, side by side, before he died was, it was, it was a gift.",Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Why are you here?,Sheldon,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" I don’t know. I was, I was hoping I was going to haunt my ex-wife.",Arthur,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 I know why. You’ve come to me because you’re my Obi-Wan.,Sheldon,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" I’m, I’m not, I’m not familiar with that. Is, is, is that an, an Internet?",Arthur,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Okay, here we go. Episode I: The Phantom Menace.",Sheldon,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Ugh, let’s get this over with.",Raj,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Since we all agree Episode I isn’t our favourite, maybe we just skip it this time.",Howard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Howard, I think you of all people should avoid espousing the principle that if something is not our favourite we should just get rid of it.",Sheldon,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" You know, I heard of this way of watching the movies called the Machete Order, where you watch Episodes IV and V, then skip Episode I, watch II and III as a flashback, and then finish with VI.",Raj,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Okay, so you’d lose most of Jar Jar, all the trade route talk and the boring senate hearings, which are like watching C-SPAN with monsters.",Howard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Get rid of the trade route part? Then how would Palpatine get Chancellor Valorum kicked out of office? How would he get himself elected? How? Can we get through one holiday without you saying something ridiculous?,Sheldon,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 It was just a suggestion.,Raj,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Well, you know what else was just a suggestion? Why don’t we change the Raisin Bran box? Hmm? And you know who got hurt by that? Every single person who eats breakfast.",Sheldon,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Wow.,Raj,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 I think he’s taking this Professor Proton thing pretty hard.,Howard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Should we try to console him?,Raj,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 You think about dying?,Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Mm. Well, I think more about if I’d have any regrets.",Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 What would you regret?,Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Mm, you know, that I didn’t travel more, take more risks, learn another language.",Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Well, at least without Sheldon here, we got to start with Episode IV.",Howard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Mm, true. I do feel guilty about him.",Raj,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Me, too.",Howard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Maybe we should see how he’s doing.,Raj,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Yeah.,Howard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 But after the cantina scene.,Raj,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Obviously.,Howard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Sheldon, dreaming he is in the living room of the apartment on his laptop.",Scene,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Look at Arthur, cracking up at a joke I told him. I’ll never hear that laugh again.",Sheldon,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 You never heard it that time.,Arthur,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Arthur. I thought you were dead.,Sheldon,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" I am. Oh, it, it’s fantastic. I mean this, this is the longest that I’ve gone without running into a men’s room in, in, in years.",Arthur,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 What’s two to one?,Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" I proposed twice, you proposed once. Two to one.",Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Oh, my. It’s not a contest.",Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 I don’t know what you’re upset about. I’m the one who’s losing.,Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Wow. Uh, you’re dead, so I’m going to let that slide. Obi-Wan Kenobi is a character from Star Wars. After his physical demise, he comes to Luke Skywalker as his mentor in spirit form.",Sheldon,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Well, that, that clears that up.",Arthur,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 You must be here to give me advice.,Sheldon,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Well, this, this is weird. Most, most of my robes open in, in the back.",Arthur,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Those are your Jedi robes.,Sheldon,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Oh, wait. What, what, what is, what is this?",Arthur,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Be careful with that.,Sheldon,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Oh. Oh. Oh, neato. I’m, uh, I’m going to need a Band-Aid.",Arthur,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 The funeral.,Scene,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" So, what did you think of your first funeral?",Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Well, I don’t want to be a jerk, but it was kind of a bummer.",Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Yeah, well, when I die, you can rent a bounce house.",Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Yeah, I thought it was working for a while, but then I found out my brother was just lowering the pencil marks on the door frame. How about you?",Bernadette,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Oh, I guess it must have been back when I was in the Girl Sprouts.",Amy,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Girl Sprouts?,Bernadette,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 My mom made it up as an alternative to the Girl Scouts. She didn’t want me selling cookies on some street corner like a whore.,Amy,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 You know Klingon.,Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 That’s true.,Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" No, I meant that as a regret.",Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 I just thought of one more.,Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 What’s that?,Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 I regret not saying yes when you asked me to marry you.,Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Well, it just wasn’t the right time.",Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Yeah.,Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 And this is also not the right time. Do not propose.,Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 What?,Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 I know that face. That’s your propose face.,Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 I was not gonna propose. It’s already two to one.,Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Sheldon’s dream.,Scene,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Where, where, where are we?",Arthur,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 This is the swampland of Dagobah. It’s where Luke was trained in the ways of the Jedi.,Sheldon,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Oh. Too bad. I thought it was Florida.,Arthur,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Okay. Fine. Would you feel better if I propose so you could turn me down again?,Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Yeah, I think I would.",Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Okay. Leonard, will you marry me?",Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Hmm.,Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" No, don’t you dare. You reject me right now and tie things up.",Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 It’s just such a big decision. I don’t want to have any regrets.,Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Amy’s apartment.,Scene,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Did you ever watch Professor Proton when you were a kid?,Amy,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" No. My dad controlled the TV, so unless someone was a Texas Ranger, Jake or the Fatman, we didn’t see it.",Bernadette,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" I never watched him, either, but he seems to be the reason that Sheldon got interested in science.",Amy,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Not me. I got into science ’cause I was always the smallest kid in school, so I thought if I became a scientist, I could invent a formula that made me taller.",Bernadette,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 That’s cute.,Amy,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 But I do appreciate them.,Sheldon,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Well, then, what am I doing in a swamp dressed like Friar Tuck? Appreciate them, Sheldon. (Sheldon is woken up by a knocking on his bedroom door.)",Arthur,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Hey, buddy. Heard you’re having a rough day. You all right?",Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 I’m okay. How was the funeral?,Sheldon,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 How did that get you into science?,Bernadette,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Oh, I went to the library and took out a book on biology to see what whores did.",Amy,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Leonard’s car.,Scene,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" On the one hand, if I say yes…",Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 This isn’t funny anymore. Just say no so we’re done with this. Will you marry me or not?,Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Ooh, interesting. Did you just propose to me again?",Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 No.,Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Really? Because I just heard will you marry me? That’s two proposals, one day. Sounds like someone wants to spend the rest of her life telling people how to spell the name Hofstadter.",Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 You know what? Fine. Do whatever you want.,Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Hey. Penny, don’t get upset. Here. I love you, but, no, I will not marry you.",Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Thank you.,Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Now, about that second proposal. On the one hand…",Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Yeah. We were hoping it might cheer you up.,Amy,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" And even though it meant we had to miss the movies, we could still be part of the fun.",Bernadette,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Well, you didn’t miss anything. We just started over.",Howard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Son of a bitch.,Bernadette,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" When Obi-Wan came to Luke on this very spot, he gave him all sorts of helpful advice. So, um, what do you got for me?",Sheldon,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Um, always, get, get a prenup.",Arthur,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 That’s it? I thought there’d be more of a reason why you’re here.,Sheldon,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Well, why, why do you think I’m here?",Arthur,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 I suppose it has something to do with your recent passing.,Sheldon,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Is, is this the, the first time you’ve lost, you know, someone close to you?",Arthur,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Oh, no. No. I’ve already had to say good-bye to 11 Dr. Whos.",Sheldon,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Yeah, I’ve, I’ve outlived a few of my doctors, too.",Arthur,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Of course, my grandfather died when I was five. My father died when I was 14.",Sheldon,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" I’m, I’m sorry about that.",Arthur,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" And now you’re gone, too. It’s like all the men I’ve looked up to have gone away.",Sheldon,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Well, you know, it’s, it’s okay to, to be sad about them. Just, just make sure, you know, you appreciate those who, who are still there for you.",Arthur,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" It was nice, you know. A lot of people showed up, told some great stories about him. Did you know that Arthur’s son is a high school sci…? (Sheldon hugs him) Hey, the guys are about to start Jedi. You want to go watch?",Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 I do. After I make them go back and watch one through five first.,Sheldon,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Sheldon, that, that’ll take us all night.",Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" That’s true. Oh, it’s a good thing I had a nap.",Sheldon,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 The apartment. ,Scene,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Boy, some of the physical comedy with Jar Jar is a little tough to watch.",Howard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 At least they toned him down in the second one.,Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Yeah, he is pretty stupid.",Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Hey, we can say it. You can’t.",Raj,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Hey, guys.",Amy,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Happy Star Wars Day.,Bernadette,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Wow. A Death Star cake.,Sheldon,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" Uh, well, it’s not May the fifth, and it’s not May the third. It’s May the fourth.",Leonard,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
" So, when is it?",Penny,7.0,22.0,The Proton Transmogrification
 Then what do you need?,Leonard,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
" Okay, it may look that way, but getting fired from that movie was the best thing that could have happened to me, okay? I finally realize I don’t need to be famous or have some big career to be happy.",Penny,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
" You know I want to marry you, but you’re only doing this because you got fired and you’re feeling sorry for yourself.",Leonard,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
 You know what? Forget it. I never should’ve brought it up.,Penny,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
" No, no. No, it’s too late. I’m your bran muffin. Probably fat-free and good for your colon.",Leonard,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
" Sweetie, you can be any pastry you want.",Penny,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
" Well, it matters a lot. I don’t want to be a bran muffin. I, I want to be a Cinnabon, you know? A strawberry Pop-Tart. Something you’re excited about even though it could give you diabetes.",Leonard,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
" What does it matter? The point is, I’m choosing you.",Penny,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
" No, it’s exactly what you’re saying. I’m the boring thing you’re choosing because I’m good for you.",Leonard,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
" What? No, that’s not what I’m saying.",Penny,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
 So I’m like a bran muffin.,Leonard,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
" Well, yeah.",Penny,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
 I’m proud of us.,Howard,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
" Last night was a little rough, but I think we’re gonna get through this.",Bernadette,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
 How you feeling?,Howard,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
" Oh, my God, yes.",Penny,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
" I’ve had it for a couple years, not important. Penny, will you marry me?",Leonard,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
 Where did you get a ring?,Penny,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
" Oh, I know. This might help.",Leonard,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
" Yeah, it kind of does, huh?",Penny,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
 I’m not sure. Just feels a little anticlimactic.,Leonard,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
 What’s wrong?,Penny,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
 All right.,Leonard,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
" Yeah, I think so.",Penny,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
" So is that it? Are, are we engaged?",Leonard,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
 Okay. Leonard: Cool.,Penny,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
 Welcome to Team Putz.,Howard,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution

 I know. Let’s go see the new Spider-Man movie.,Sheldon,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
 Should we do something for her?,Amy,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
 You are a putz.,Bernadette,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
 So she’s gonna be laid up for at least six weeks.,Raj,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution

 Do you know how to set it up?,Raj,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
 We set it up in Howie’s old room.,Bernadette,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
 All right. Now what?,Raj,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
 She’ll use it. All I need is to rig it with a fishing pole and a HoneyBaked Ham.,Howard,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
" If she isn’t gonna use it, then why are we doing this?",Raj,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
 Crushing my will to live isn’t exercise.,Howard,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
 I get plenty of exercise.,(off),7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
 The doctor says you need to get exercise.,Howard,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
 You mean a forklift?,Howard,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
 Maybe we should get one of those machines to help her up the stairs.,Bernadette,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
" Okay, she’s all settled in the guest room.",Howard,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
" Hey, should we get our seats?",Man,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
 I know.,Sheldon,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
" It only gets funnier when you explain it, Sheldon.",Leonard,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
" Ah, very good. Because a gorilla go-go dancer of any sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the Holocaust.",Sheldon,7.0,23.0,The Gorilla Dissolution
