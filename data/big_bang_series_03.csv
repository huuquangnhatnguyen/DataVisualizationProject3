" I assumed as much. But never fear. Like the subordinate male protagonist in countless action movies who disappears half way through the second reel, I have returned to save the day.

" Oh, they think we’re flanking, they’re playing right into our hands. On the count of three, we execute the flying scissor. One, two…",Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Whoa! Did you see that?,Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 See what?,Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" That chick, she smiled at me.",Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" No, she didn’t.",Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Of course not.,Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Of course not. Why would they be? Why would I ask? Why am I rambling? Why don’t you stop me?,Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Leonard, look, if you want to meet my friends, that would be great. I just, you know, I didn’t want you to be bored.",Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 I wouldn’t be bored. Why would I be bored?,Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Well, ’cause they’re not genius scientists.",Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Son of a bitch.,Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Leonard’s car.,Scene,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" You’re a sucky friend, you know that? A sucky, sucky friend.",Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 What was I supposed to do? She gave me that come-hither look.,Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 If she gave you any look at l. It was a you suck look.,Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 I would’ve caught up to her if I hadn’t pulled a hammy.,Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Oh, please, you weigh 80 pounds. You don’t have a hammy.",Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" So, Penny doesn’t want me around her friends, I embarrass her. What else could it be?",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Well, her actions could be out of concern for your feelings. Perhaps she’s excluded you from these gatherings because she’s scouting for a new mate and doesn’t want to do it in front of you.",Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Oh, how kind of her.",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Agreed. Most primates don’t show that sort of discretion. A female bonobo will copulate with a new male in front of the old one without so much as a how do you do?,Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 The apartment. Leonard and Raj are watching a football game on the television. ,Scene,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Okay, a complete pass. First down, New England. I think I’m starting to get this.",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Really? The only thing I’ve learned in the last two hours is that American men love drinking beer, pee too often and have trouble getting erections.",Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Focus on the game, not the commercials, Raj.",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" I’m just saying, maybe if you people cut back on the beer, you could get out of the bathroom and satisfy your women without pharmaceutical help.",Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Hey.,Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Hi.,Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 How was your football party?,Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 It was pretty good. We won.,Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Oh, that’s excellent. It’s a weird figure of speech, isn’t it, we won when you weren’t",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 I’m glad to hear it.,Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Oh, hey, on a related subject, are you embarrassed to have me around your friends?",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Oh, my god, no. Why would you ask that?",Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Well, you know, I just noticed I haven’t really met any of them.",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Sure you have.,Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Well, yeah, no, I met the huge ex-boyfriend and the smaller yet still larger than me ex-boyfriend. Were they here today?",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Huh… Scrimmage…,Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 The line of scrimmage is the imaginary transverse line separating the offence from the defence.,Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Oh.,Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Sheldon knows football?,Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Apparently.,Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Penny, I like all sorts of people. In fact, some of my best friends aren’t geniuses.",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Like who?,Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Okay, some of my Facebook friends aren’t geniuses. My point is, if we’re going to be a couple, I should be friends with your friends.",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Okay, great. Well, then why don’t you come over next Saturday and watch the game with us.",Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Another football game?,Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 They have them every week.,Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Did not know that.,Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 You wanted to meet my friends.,Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Sure, sure, just I don’t know much about football.",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Oh, that’s okay, a lot of the guys’ girlfriends don’t know football. They just kind of drink and talk in the kitchen.",Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Great.,Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Please, I’m asking you as a friend.",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Are you making this a tier one friendship request?,Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Yes.,Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Fine.,Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 I really appreciate this.,Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Raj, what are you doing here? You were supposed to help me pimp out my Vespa.",(arriving),3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" I’m sorry, are you under the impression that we’re still friends?",Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Oh come on, you’re not still grinding on the kite thing, are you?",Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" It’s not just the kite thing. Every time we go some place, you think you can just dump me whenever someone prettier comes along, even though you don’t have a shot with them.",Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 But I had a shot with that jogger.,Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Fine. Paint green flames on your little scooter with her. (Leaves),Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 It’s not a little scooter. It’s the second biggest Vespa they make! Are you watching football?,Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" There’s no fooling you. Now, what is this sacks statistic they put up there?",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" All I know about Saks is, my mother shops there.",Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Sacks, sacks…",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 It’s football nomenclature for when a quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage.,Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Leonard, wait. Am I correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted by Penny’s peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her?",Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Well, I wouldn’t put it exactly that way.",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 How would you put it?,Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Yeah, okay, like you said.",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Huh. Seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for intercourse. Don’t you have access to women who will do it for money? By the way, another accepted usage for the term ho.",Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" I mean, Quidditch, sure. But football?",Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Sheldon, how do you know this stuff?",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" I grew up in Texas. Football is ubiquitous in Texas. Pro football, college football, high school football, peewee football, in fact, every form of football except the original, European football, which most Texans believe to be a Commie plot.",Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Unbelievable.,Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" If you’re interested, I also know all about frying meat that isn’t chicken as if it were chicken.",Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 So you could teach me?,Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Football or chicken-fried meats?,Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Football. I’m going to Penny’s on Saturday to watch a game with her friends and I don’t want to look like an idiot. I want to blend in.,Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" If you want to blend in with Penny’s friends, I’d think looking like an idiot would be the perfect camouflage.",Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Come on, Sheldon, please teach me about football. It’ll be fun.",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" That’s exactly what my father said. Come to the games, watch the games, week in and week out from the time I was five until I went off to college. Longest seven years of my life.",Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Wow, you just don’t get it, do you? Buying me something pretty isn’t going to make our problem just go away.",Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Look, I admit I haven’t always been the best friend I could be.",Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" You’ve been a sucky friend, a sucky, sucky friend.",Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Stipulated.,Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" And you do it all the time. Last week in the mall at Radio Shack, we were looking for a phone with giant numbers for your mother, and I suddenly realize you’re not even there.",Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Yeah, yeah. All right, Poindexter, sit down, shut up and listen.",Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 I’m sorry?,Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" That’s how my father always began our football conversations. And if you’d like, after the game, I’ll take you outside and teach you how to shoot close enough to a racoon that it craps itself.",Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 The kitchen. Sheldon is making toast in a cylon toaster which burns an image of a cylon onto the toast. ,Scene,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 When are you going to stop making Cylon toast?,Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 When I have enough to destroy all the human toast on the battlestar known as Galactica. Is that what you’re wearing to watch football at Penny’s?,Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 What’s wrong with a football jersey?,Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Nothing. That, however, appears to be a football cocktail dress.",Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" I’s the smallest size they had, except the one for dogs. I can’t believe they had one for dogs.",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Oh, yes. Canine football fans are a common sight in Texas. Cats, however, refuse to wear sporting apparel. My sister found that out the hard way.",Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Anyway, wish me luck.",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 I… I do enjoy the La Brea Tar Pits.,Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Really, now? With the traffic and the parking, it’s… okay, fine. The Tar Pits. Let’s go.",Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Oh, why can’t I stay mad at you?",Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Penny’s apartment. Everyone is watching football.,Scene,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Go! Go! Go! Go-Go-Go-Go! Yes! Are you people watching this? Is this amazing or what?,Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Good-Bye, Sheldon.",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Hold on I believe that social convention dictate you not arrive empty-Handed. Would you like to bring some Cylon toast?,Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Yeah, no, I’m trying to fit in, not get laughed at.",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 What’s funny about Cylon toast?,Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Raj’s apartment. Raj is watching a Bollywood movie. There is a knock on the door.,Scene,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 It’s open.,Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Hey, pal.",Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 What do you want?,Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 I brought you a little gift. New kite.,Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" The kite you made me lose was an authentic Patang, an Indian fighting kite that my brother sent to me from New Delhi. It took me a day to put together and two days to paint. This is Hello Kitty.",Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Yeah, but it comes with a little coin purse. Does a Patang?",Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 I know. I just need you stop talking.,Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.",Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Sheldon, come in.",Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Thank you. I’d like to make a sandwich, but I’m out of bread.",Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 There’s some in the fridge.,Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" I know, I know.",Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 And where were you?,Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Getting shot down by the girl at Hot Dog on a Stick. But in my defence, she was gorgeous, and working that squeezer to make the lemonade, going up and down and up and down. It was like a free pole dance right in the middle of the food court.",Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 You’re impossible.,Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Hey, at least I can talk to women without being drunk.",Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Excuse me, I have selective mutism, a recognized medical disorder. You’re just a douche.",Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" No. You know what? Maybe that’s what this whole thing’s about. You’re not mad at me, you’re mad at yourself.",Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" No, I’m mad at you. I hate myself, but I’m mad at you.",Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Fine. You’re mad at me. I get it. Now, how about we go spend the day together? Just the two of us. We’ll go anywhere you want.",Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 I don’t know.,Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Come on. Let me take you someplace nice.,Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Oh, look at that. The Oklahoma coach has thrown down a red flag indicating he’s challenging the ruling on the field. I hope he’s right, ’cause if he’s not, it’ll cost him one of his three time-Outs.",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" You know, Leonard, honey, I wouldn’t mind if you wanted to go fly kites with Sheldon.",Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" No, I’ll watch the end of the game. Besides, there’s only three minutes left.",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Until half time.,Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 This is just half? We’ve been here for hours.,Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Sweetie, that’s a highlight from the ’98 championship game.",Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Oh. Did not know that.,Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 How much beer have you had?,Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" None, why?",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Oh. I was just kind of hoping you were drunk. Now we’re back live.,Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Okay, yeah. I can see the difference.",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Oh, where’s the flag, that’s intentional grounding.",hat,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Totally.,guy,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" That completely was a forward pass, which they threw intentionally incomplete to avoid loss of yardage or to conserve time. I can’t believe they’re not being penalized with the loss of a down and by having to move the line of scrimmage back to the spot of the foul.",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Here, have some pizza, sweetie.",Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Penny, you know I’m lactose intolerant.",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 No. This is our day.,Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" If you want to chase after her, chase after her.",Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Ah, who am I kidding? I wouldn’t have a shot with a girl like that.",Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Don’t put yourself down. You’re a very attractive man.,Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 You think so?,Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" You shouldn’t keep your bread in the refrigerator. Staleness is caused by crystallization of the starch molecules, which occurs faster at cool temperatures.",Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" On Earth, we say thank you.",Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" So Leonard, how goes the mimesis?",Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Mimesis?,Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 You know. Mimesis. An action in which the mimic takes on the properties of a specific object or organism. Mimesis.,Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 What the hell are you talking about?,Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" I’m attempting to communicate with you without my meaning becoming apparent to those around you. Let me try again. Have the indigenous fauna accepted you as one of their own? Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.",Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Oh, I guess so.",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Good. Oh, FYI. After I eat my sandwich, I’m taking Koothrappali’s Patang kite out for a test run. Would you like to get your delta-wing raptor and join me?",Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" I don’t want to fly kites, Sheldon. We’re watching football here.",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 I can see that. I was providing you with an alternative. A courtesy I was never offered in similar circumstances.,Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Actually, in this case, I think she was.",Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Really?,Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Yeah.,Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Bye.,Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 What a douche.,Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 And you’re gonna be here for a couple more.,Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Oh, you’re kidding me.",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 No.,Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Nice meeting all of you.,Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" So, yeah, anyway, that’s my boyfriend. He is really smart.",Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 The Le Brea Tar Pits.,Scene,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 I really like my saber-toothed cat. Thank you.,Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" My pleasure. Maybe after lunch, we can go to Marie Callender’s and have some pie.",Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 I’d like that. This is turning out to be a perfect Saturday.,Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Good. I’m glad. Oh, man. Did you see the way she smiled at me?",Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Fine. Go ahead.,Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Yes, she did.",Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Come on, scissors, scissors!",Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Hold my line.,Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex

 Victory!,Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Well, actually, the risk of throat cutting is very low. On the other hand, severe string burn is a real and ever-Present danger.",Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 You want to come watch?,Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Oh, gee, sounds amazing, but, um, I’ve got some friends coming over. Not a big thing, we’re just gonna watch the Nebraska game.",Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Oh. Football, sure.",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Good guess.,Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" I would’ve invited you, but I know you’re not a football fan.",Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" No, no, I’m not, so, great. You’ve got plans doing something you like, I’ve got plans doing something I like, so it’s good.",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Well, maybe we’ll hang out later, you know, after everybody’s gone.",Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Yeah, great.",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 See ya.,Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Well, this sucks.",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Yeah. Absolutely. It wouldn’t kill you to take a Pilates class with me now and then, but you have a certain wiry appeal.",Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Yeah, well, it doesn’t matter ‘cause she wasn’t really smiling at me.",Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" I’m sorry, I got bored and drifted off. Where exactly in the interaction did the sucking lie?",Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Leonard just realized that Penny’s been hiding him from her friends because he’s a tiny, little man who flies kites.",Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex

 Kites ho!,Howard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Kites ho!,Raj,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Kites, ho!",three,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Excuse me. You’re misusing the word ho. It’s an interjection used to call attention to a destination, not an object, as in, uh, Land, ho! Or, uh, Westward, ho!",Sheldon,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Kites, ho!",guys,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Hey, guys. What you doing? Going out to discover electricity?",Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" If you’re referring to the work of Benjamin Franklin, he did not discover electricity, he merely used a kite to determine that lightning consists of electricity. He also invented the Franklin stove, bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter. Kites, ho.",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 We’re heading out for some kite fighting.,Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
 Kite fighting?,Penny,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Oh, yeah. It’s an extremely competitive, cutthroat sport.",Leonard,3.0,6.0,The Cornhusker Vortex
" Well, he’s definitely not gay.",Penny,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
" Oh, a definitely not gay musician sleeping on my girlfriend’s couch. Yippee.",Leonard,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
" Okay, we went out a little bit, a long time ago, but we were never like going out.",Penny,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
" Okay, not to be pedantic, but the last I checked went out was in fact the past tense of going out, which I think we all know is a popular euphemism for saw each other naked.",Leonard,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
 I’ll just roll for you.,Sheldon,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
 Do you have a problem with Justin staying with me?,Penny,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
 What was your first clue?,Leonard,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
 Uh-oh! Industrial accident.,Sheldon,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification

 Leonard’s car.,Scene,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
 I don’t get how she can just announce that an old boyfriend is going to be sleeping on her couch.,Leonard,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
" Hey, I thought of a game we can play in the car.",Sheldon,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
" I don’t want to play a game, Sheldon.",Leonard,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
" It’s called Scientists. Now, I will name three scientists, then you will put them in order of the size of their contribution to their respective fields. To make this game even more compelling, you must consider only the contribution of the man to the field, not the validity of the field itself. For example, Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayn made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy than Halbert Vanderplatt made to neurobiology. Okay, ready to have some fun?",Sheldon,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
 He’s not some guy. He’s my friend.,Penny,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification

" Oh, we need to kill a couple hours till the next showing of Time Bandits.",Leonard,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
" Oh, well, no problem. I was thinking of closing early and going home, but let’s face it, that’s just a slightly smaller lonely room filled with comic books.",Stuart,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
" Thanks, Stuart. Let me ask you something. Do you think it’s okay for Penny to have an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch?",Leonard,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
" No, I mean, she’s obviously way out of line.",Howard,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
 Thank you!,Leonard,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification

 I am not going to fold.,Leonard,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification

" Come on. At the very least, when she found out Leonard was upset about it, she should’ve backed off.",Howard,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification

" Okay, sorry.",Howard,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
" Maybe it means something different in this country. Back in India, it means you’re upset with a guy named Howard!",Raj,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
 I said I’m sorry.,Howard,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
 Sorry doesn’t make up for the fact that I had to make chicken and rice with this vegan guy. Do you know what vegan chicken and rice is? Rice!,Raj,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification

 Yes.,Penny,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
" Where exactly does the half-sandwich come from? Are you giving me half of someone else’s sandwich, or do I have to wait for someone else in the restaurant to order the other half?",Sheldon,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
" No, no, Sheldon, they just make a half-sandwich.",Penny,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
" You can’t make a half-sandwich. If it’s not half of a whole sandwich, it’s just a small sandwich.",Sheldon,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
" Okay, fine, it’s soup and a small sandwich. Is that what you want?",Penny,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
 You mean like when a guy’s upset because his friend agreed to take a cooking class with him and then doesn’t show up because he’s doing a juice fast with his mother?,Raj,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
 I didn’t know you were upset about that.,Howard,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification

 Is Leonard coming?,Penny,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
 Were you under the impression that Leonard has no complaints about you?,Sheldon,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
" Like what? Yeah, yeah, I see you, you’re making a little cheque sign in the air, I got it, just hold your horses. What does Leonard complain about?",Penny,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
" Your driving, the plethora of stuffed animals on your bed that stare at him during your amorous activities, your constant tardiness, your singing.",Sheldon,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
 My singing?,Penny,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
" That’s actually from my list, but Leonard would be a fool if he didn’t agree with it.",Sheldon,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
" Okay, if Leonard has so many problems with me, why hasn’t he just said so?",Penny,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification

" It doesn’t matter why he told me. It’s true, isn’t it?",Penny,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
" Okay, yeah, it’s true, but I can live with that stuff. What I can’t live with is you casually informing me that some guy’s going to be staying in your apartment without even asking me first!",Leonard,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification
" That isn’t even your problem, the problem is you don’t trust me!",Penny,3.0,7.0,The Guitarist Amplification

" Oh, gee, thanks, Leonard. That didn’t occur to me. If he doesn’t apologize by 5 o’clock he is going to spend the night in jail.",Penny,3.0,16.0,The Excelsior Acquisition
" No, no. I will never have another chance to have gelato with Stan Lee because opportunities to have gelato with Stan Lee come but once in a lifetime. The moving finger writes, and having writ, moves on!",Sheldon,3.0,16.0,The Excelsior Acquisition

" Plus, you didn’t get to meet Stan Lee.",Howard,3.0,16.0,The Excelsior Acquisition
" Okay, that’s enough, Howard. The poor guy’s had a tough time. He had to spend the entire afternoon in jail wearing that suit.",Leonard,3.0,16.0,The Excelsior Acquisition
" You’re right, so it would be cruel to mention that after he finished signing autographs, Stan Lee took Stuart and us out for gelato.",Howard,3.0,16.0,The Excelsior Acquisition

" Sure, yeah, name it.",Stuart,3.0,16.0,The Excelsior Acquisition

 What kind of deal?,Penny,3.0,16.0,The Excelsior Acquisition
 Sweet.,Howard,3.0,16.0,The Excelsior Acquisition
" Plus, I get to hang out with him again at the hearing. This is going to look great hanging next to my restraining order from Leonard Nimoy.",Sheldon,3.0,16.0,The Excelsior Acquisition

 Will you hold on to this for a couple of days?,Leonard,3.0,17.0,The Precious Fragmentation

 This ring.,Leonard,3.0,17.0,The Precious Fragmentation
 What ring?,Penny,3.0,17.0,The Precious Fragmentation

" Hey, guys. Enjoying your food that I actually brought you instead of promising food, but bringing you a box of random crap?",Penny,3.0,17.0,The Precious Fragmentation

" But it could be part of your problem. Let me give you an example. When I was eight, I won a ribbon at the science fair for my project, “Do Lima Beans Grow Better to Classical Music.” But my mother pointed out that it was just a rehash of my brother’s earlier “Do Lima Beans Grow Worse to Rock ‘n’ Roll.” I felt so guilty, I gave the ribbon back.",Leonard,3.0,18.0,The Pants Alternative

" Sit down, we want to talk to you.",Leonard,3.0,18.0,The Pants Alternative
 The apartment. The guys are watching Avatar in 3D. All are wearing 3D glasses except Raj.,Scene,3.0,18.0,The Pants Alternative
" Yeah, the one thing the William Shatner of theoretical physics needed was an ego boost.",Howard,3.0,18.0,The Pants Alternative
" Well, good for him.",Raj,3.0,18.0,The Pants Alternative
" I won! This is astonishing. Not that I won the award, no one deserves it more. Actually, I guess I misspoke. It’s not astonishing, more like inevitable. I’m not sure what to do first. Maybe I should call my mother. Wait! I know, I’m going to conduct an interview with myself and post it online.",Sheldon,3.0,18.0,The Pants Alternative
 You won.,Leonard,3.0,18.0,The Pants Alternative
 I won?,Sheldon,3.0,18.0,The Pants Alternative
" Oh, I’m so glad you asked it like that. You.",Leonard,3.0,18.0,The Pants Alternative
" And you want to rub my nose in the fact that my contributions are being overlooked again? I am the William Shatner of theoretical physics. All right, I’ll play. What self-important, preening fraud are they honouring this year?",Sheldon,3.0,18.0,The Pants Alternative
" Hey, Sheldon, I was up in the administration office, and I happened to overhear the name of the winner of this year’s Chancellor’s Award for Science.",Leonard,3.0,18.0,The Pants Alternative
" It amazes me how you constantly obsess over fictional details when there are more important things in the real world to worry about. For example, why wasn’t William Shatner in the new Star Trek movie?",Sheldon,3.0,18.0,The Pants Alternative
" My point is, if I were a horse or a bird, I’d be very nervous around James Cameron.",Raj,3.0,18.0,The Pants Alternative
 What’s your point?,Howard,3.0,18.0,The Pants Alternative
" So, when they ride horses and fly on the birds, they also use their ponytails.",Raj,3.0,18.0,The Pants Alternative
" Yeah, so?",Howard,3.0,18.0,The Pants Alternative
" Okay in Avatar when they have sex in Pandora they hook up their ponytails, so we know their ponytails are like their junk.",Raj,3.0,18.0,The Pants Alternative
 The university cafeteria.,Scene,3.0,18.0,The Pants Alternative
" Hey, Leonard, where do you come down on giant ants?",Howard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Sheldon says impossible. Howard and I say not only possible, but as a mode of transportation, way cooler than a Batmobile.",Raj,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Leonard and Penny are in Penny’s bed.,Scene,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Having a little trouble catching your breath there?,Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" No, no, I’m good. If my P.E. teachers had told me this is what I was training for, I would have tried a lot harder.",Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Do or do not. There is no try.,Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Really? Because every time we’ve talked about unusual animal genitals, you’ve always had some pretty strong and controversial opinions.",Raj,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 What do you want from me? I just don’t give a rat’s ass.,Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" You are ignoring the square-cube law. The giant ant would be crushed under the weight of its own exoskeleton. And for the record, the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is jet pack, hoverboard, transporter, Batmobile, and then giant ant.",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Seriously? You have nothing better to do than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants?,Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 What’s with him?,Howard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Perhaps he’s at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle.,Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Are you saying he’s man-struating?,Howard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Not literally. But as far back as the 17th century, scientists observed a 33-day fluctuation in men’s hormone levels.",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Interesting. That might explain my weepy days in the middle of the month. You know what I’m talking about.,Raj,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 The comic book store.,Scene,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Okay, forget giant ants. How about giant rabbits?",Howard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Big or small, I don’t like rabbits. They always look like they’re about to say something, but they never do.",Raj,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Rabbits do have a respiratory system that would support great size. And on a side note, they are one of the few mammals whose scrotum is in front of the penis.",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Maybe that’s what they want to talk about.,Raj,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Leonard, where do you stand on giant rabbits and scrotal position?",Howard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 I honestly don’t care.,Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Oh, hey.",Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Good, Penny, reminder, bowling tonight at seven o’clock.",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Would that be a giant rat’s ass?,Howard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" For the record, giant rats are possible.",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Can we please talk about something else? Maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet?,Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Okay, how about this for a topic, why is Leonard being a giant douche? Assuming giant douches are possible.",Howard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Of course they are. Leonard’s being one.,Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Maybe he’s having a lover’s spat with Penny.,Raj,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" No, there was no spat.",Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Oh, but something happened.",Howard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 I don’t want to talk about it.,Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 But I sense you’re going to and I don’t want to hear about it. Excuse me.,Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" What’d you do, Romeo? You pour maple syrup all over your body and ask her if she was in the mood for a short stack?",Howard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Did you think it would be funny to put on a pair of her panties and jump around, but it wound up just creeping her out?",Raj,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 What? No.,Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" I’m just asking, dude. It happens.",Raj,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 These are my own bowling shoes.,Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Then what’s with the disinfectant?,Howard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Oh. Ouch.,Stuart,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 That is what is referred to as a burn on you.,Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Did you ask her to start waxing?,Howard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 No.,Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Did you start waxing?,Raj,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 No.,Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" While making love, did you accidentally spank your own ass and cry out Mommy?",Howard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 I’m walking away from you now.,Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 That wasn’t a no.,Howard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Yeah, I think we’re getting close.",Raj,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 The stairwell.,Scene,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Did you take a Benadryl and fall asleep while pleasuring her? Because you can die that way.,Howard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Oh, that would be a good way to go.",Raj,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Hi.,Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" I’m sure you’re probably sick of Star Trek questions, but, Whoopi Goldberg, you ever hit that?",Howard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Ah, beer. The magic elixir that can turn this poor, shy Indian boy into the life of the party. Oh, yeah.",Raj,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Oh, right, bowling.",Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 You don’t have to come if you don’t want to.,Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" No, no, it’s okay. I mean, let’s face it, you guys would get creamed without me.",Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" We would indeed. In this particular case, your lack of femininity works to our advantage.",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" It’s always nice chatting with you, Sheldon.",Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Sarcasm?,Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Thinly veiled contempt.,Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Remember, seven o’clock.",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Got it.,Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Pacific Daylight time!,Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Bite me!,Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Please reserve that butch spirit for the lanes.,Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 The bowling alley.,Scene,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 I thought you were bringing your own bowling shoes.,Howard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 I am not pushing anything.,Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 You are. You don’t get to decide when I’m ready to say I love you!,Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 I know where my feet have been.,Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Hey, Penny! And you guys. Albino Bob couldn’t make it, so I brought a substitute. I believe some of you know Wil Wheaton.",Stuart,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Hi, Sheldon. How’s it going?",Wil,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Well, well, well. If it isn’t Wil Wheaton, the Green Goblin to my Spider-Man, the Pope Paul the fifth to my Galileo, the Internet Explorer to my Firefox.",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" You’re not still carrying a grudge because I beat you at that card tournament, are you?",Wil,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" I’m the proud owner of Wil Wheaton stinks dot com, dot net, and dot org. What does that tell you?",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 It tells me that I am living rent-free right here (pointing at Sheldon’s head). You ready to bowl?,Wil,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Oh, I’m ready. I don’t know if Stuart told you what you’re up against tonight, but before you stands the co-captain of the East Texas Christian Youth Holy Roller Bowling League championship team. Seven to twelve year-old division. Also, Penny’s pretty good.",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Great. Then it’s on.,Wil,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Oh, foolish Wil Wheaton, it was never off.",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Yes!,Wil,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" A common spare. The Miss Congeniality of the bowling pageant. Before you jump on Twitter to tout your modest accomplishment, watch how it’s really done. I am the ball. My thoughts are its thoughts. Its holes are my holes. (Gets a strike) Yes. Tweet that, Tweety Bird.",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Hey, I just wanted to tell you I’m a big fan.",Howard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Oh, thanks.",Wil,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Again, I’m sorry.",Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 And let me tell you sleep did not come easily with Leonard in the next room singing along with Alanis Morrisette.,Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Chilli cheese fry?,Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Yes. I love chilli cheese fries.,Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Really? You love them?,Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Yeah, why?",Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 No reason. I’m just glad to hear you’re comfortable saying you love something.,Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Do you really want to get into this right now?,Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Get into what? Why wouldn’t you love the chilli cheese fries? They’ve been in your life a long time. They make you happy. They deserve to know.,Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Okay, look, you just caught me by surprise last night. I didn’t know what to say.",Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Okay, well, now you’ve had some time to think about it. So, what do you want to say?",Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 I’m not sure.,Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 How can you not be sure?,Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Okay, this isn’t the place to have this conversation.",Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" No, the place to have the conversation was in bed after I said, I love you, and you said, Thank you, good night.",Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Don’t push it, Leonard.",Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" What? No, it’s okay. We don’t have to talk ’cause there’s nothing to talk about. Everything’s good.",Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Really? So, you didn’t get all snarky ’cause I said something nice to a bowl of chilli fries?",Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Ah, the premature I love you.",Raj,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 I guessed premature. Does that count?,Howard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Penny’s apartment door.,Scene,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" (Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny.",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 What?,Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 This is for you.,Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Ice cream?,Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" I’ve been familiarizing myself with female emotional crises by studying the comic strip Cathy. When she’s upset, she says Ach and eats ice cream.",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Um, Ach.",Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" If you were a cat, I would have brought you a lasagna.",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Did Leonard send you over here?,Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" No, we haven’t spoken since your abrupt departure last night caused us to forfeit to Stuart and his dastardly ringer Wil Wheaton.",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Yeah, I’m sorry about that.",Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 I’m not too proud to admit that I cried myself to sleep.,Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Still don’t get it.,Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" It’s a blindingly clever play on words. By appropriating his character’s name and adding the S, we imply that we we’ll be the crushers of Wesley.",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 You’re kidding.,Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 No. Clearly another woman in dire need of ice cream.,Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" All right, Sheldon, what part of this is supposed to make me feel better?",Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 The part where I tell you I’ve engineered a rematch with Stuart’s team for tonight.,Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Oh, honey, I don’t know. Things are a little weird with Leonard right now.",Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" You want me to remove him from the team? I’m the captain, I can do that.",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" No, no, that’s okay. Just let me talk to him, and I’ll get back to you.",Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 When are you going to talk to him?,Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 I don’t know.,Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 He’s in the laundry room now. Now would be a good time.,Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" You’re not gonna leave me alone until I do it, are you?",Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Oh, I think we both know the answer to that question.",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 The laundry room.,Scene,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 I think we should talk now.,Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 All right.,Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" It’s a custom, not a rule.",Wil,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" All right, maybe I overreacted. So we’re in two different places emotionally. So what? And maybe I’m a little ahead of you. That’s fine. You know. In fact, it makes sense, ’cause let’s face it, I’ve been in this relationship two years longer than you.",Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Look, Leonard, you have to know how much I care about you. It’s just that I’ve said the L word too soon before, and it didn’t work out very well.",Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Really? I wouldn’t know what that’s like.,Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" I’m sorry. You know what I’m talking about, though.",Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Yeah, I do.",Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" So, we’re good?",Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Yes, that’s what I’m telling you. We are good. We are great.",Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" All right! Fence mended, problem swept under the rug. Time to bowl! Yes, I was eavesdropping, there’s a lot at stake here.",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 The bowling alley.,Scene,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Attention, all bowlers. I’ve taken the liberty of having these made for our rematch.",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 The Wesley Crushers?,Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" No, not the Wesley Crushers. The Wesley “Crushers.”",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 I don’t get it.,Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Wesley Crusher was Wil Wheaton’s character on Star Trek.,Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Gets us out of our heads. You get in your head, you start to overthink, overanalyze, obsess, you worry. That’s not what we’re doing tonight. Tonight we’re just throwing a ball at some pins.",Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Yeah, that’s right.",Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Okay, I’m sorry, honey, but the Wesley Crushers sounds like a bunch of people who like Wesley Crusher.",Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" What? No! Again, it’s not the Wesley Crushers. It’s the Wesley “Crushers.”",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" You know, if you want it to mean you’re crushing Wesley, it’d be the “Wesley” Crushers.",Howard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Do you people even hear yourselves? It’s not the Wesley Crushers. It’s not the “Wesley” Crushers. It’s the Wesley “Crushers.”,Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Hey, look. They named their team after me.",Wil,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" No, it’s not the… Never mind.",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" So, we’re all clear on the bet and the stakes?",Stuart,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Oh, yes. The losers will be publicly humiliated in a fashion to be chosen by the victor. FYI, I plan on having you publish a scientific paper expounding the discredited Velikovsky hypothesis.",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Ouch again.,Stuart,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Hey, Sheldon, I just wanted you to know that I’m really looking forward to wiping the floor with you.",Wil,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Oh, yes? Well, before I respond, let me ask you a question. Is your mother a good or poor bowler?",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 After you.,Wil,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" No, after you, as we are currently crushing you, Wesley.",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 It’s customary for the player on the right-hand lane to bowl first.,Wil,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Wil, you’re up.",Stuart,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Oh, that’s me.",Wil,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 I so loathe you.,Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" That’s right, Sheldon. Embrace the dark side.",Wil,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 That’s not even from your franchise!,Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" I, um, I want you to know that even though we’re on opposite sides, I, I bear you no ill will.",Stuart,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Thank you, Stuart. It’s nice to know.",Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Mmm, mmm. People from opposite sides often have good relationships. You know, Romeo and Juliet, Tony and Maria from West Side Story, what’s-his-name and the big blue chick in Avatar. I’m gonna bowl now.",Stuart,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Be the ball, Howard.",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Leave me alone, Sheldon.",Howard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 You weren’t the ball.,Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Hey, thanks.",Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" This is fun, huh?",Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Yeah.,Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 It’s good that we got out and did something physical.,Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Mm-hmm.,Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 I’m not pressuring you.,Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Yeah, you are! Just back off!",Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Mm-hmm, and someday, we don’t know when, maybe you’ll love me back. Ooh, I’m up.",Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Shel-don! Shel-don! Shel-don! Shel-don!,(chanting),3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Excuse me. I don’t know who you’re chanting for as I am currently the ball.,Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball!,(chanting),3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Thank you, Jesus! As my mother would say.",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 I’m glad you patched things up with your boyfriend.,Wil,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Oh, yeah, me, too.",Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 It’s always tough when the L bomb gets dropped and you’re not ready for it.,Wil,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Tell me about it.,Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" I dated this one girl, and I told her that I loved her, and she said she wasn’t sure. And she strung me along for almost two years. It was brutal.",Wil,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Oh, I’m sorry.",Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Thanks. Yeah, I wish she had just broken up with me right there, put me out of my misery.",Wil,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Really?,Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Yeah, would have been kinder.",Wil,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 The comic book store.,Scene,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah, I’m telling you the Match.com chicks are much looser than on eHarmony. You know, I, I gotta call you back. I won a bet, and it’s time to collect.",Stuart,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Did you let Wil Wheaton get in your head?,Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 What are you talking about?,Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 He’s evil. He plays evil mind games. Did he tell you his grandmother died?,Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 No!,Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Well, if he does, don’t believe it. He’s not above playing the dead meemaw card.",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Yes!,Wil,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Enjoy the accolades now, Wil Wheaton, but like your time on Star Trek: Next Generation, your smug self-satisfaction will be short-lived.",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Penny, you’re up.",Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" All right, remember, his meemaw’s alive and be the ball.",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Yeah, I got it.",Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 We really need a strike here.,Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 I know.,Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 So just take your time and concentrate.,Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Leonard, stop pressuring me.",Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" I don’t know about you, but I feel empowered.",Raj,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Okay, I’m sorry. I’ll shut up.",Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 I didn’t mean shut up.,Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Fine. Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it.",Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" No, this isn’t fair to you, Leonard. I’m sorry.",Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Wait! Where are you going? Penny, come back! I’ll get you ice cream!",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence

" Tough luck, Sheldon.",Wil,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence

 Do you think I would really break up a couple just to win a bowling match?,Wil,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence

 Good. Keep thinking that.,Wil,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence

 You guys still on for bowling tonight?,Stuart,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
" Oh, yes. In fact, I’ve prepared some trash talk for the occasion. You bowl like your mama. Unless, of course, she bowls well. In which case, you bowl nothing like her.",Sheldon,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 Did you just quote Star Wars?,Leonard,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence
 I believe I quoted Empire Strikes Back.,Penny,3.0,19.0,The Wheaton Recurrence

 Smother Sheldon in his sleep? Wouldn’t that be wrong?,Leonard,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 I think we can do it.,Penny,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst

 I’m hungry now.,Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 Interesting. I’ll have to have you over for spaghetti some night.,Penny,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" Well, of course I’m hungry. And as I have no plans to eat with any other team, I will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto. Mm, mm, mm!",Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" Sheldon, I got you your tangerine chicken. I hope you’re hungry.",Leonard,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst

 Really?,Penny,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" Good, good. I’m glad we’re still friends.",Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" Okay, here’s the protocol, you and I are still friends, and you stop saying coitus.",Penny,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" Well, we could if it were true. But as you live in the same building, you see each other all the time. The variable which has changed is the coitus.",Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" God, can we please just say no longer seeing each other?",Penny,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" I think you mean telekinetically. And no, I just wasn’t sure of the proper protocol now that you and Leonard are no longer having coitus.",Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" Okay. Are, are you hoping to get it telepathically?",Penny,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 I was going to get my mail.,Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst

 I never stopped hanging out with you.,Leonard,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" That’s the sauce my mother uses. She likes cooking Italian because according to her, that’s what the Romans made Jesus eat.",Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 Yep.,Penny,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 I’d rather you pretend I didn’t say it. I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce.,Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 I’ll pretend I didn’t hear it.,Penny,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" He seems all right. Although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on. Oh, but now that I think of it, he asked me not to tell you that.",Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 Mmm. How’s Leonard doing?,Penny,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 Bazinga.,Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst

" So, how you been?",Penny,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" Or fornication. Yeah. But that has judgmental overtones, so I’ll hold that in reserve.",Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 Great.,Penny,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" Harsh terms. But all right, I’ll just substitute intercourse.",Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst

 What?,Howard,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 Which one picks last?,Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" So would Ben Affleck. The point is, in a situation like this you got to pick sides. You’re either on Team Leonard or Team Penny.",Howard,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 Is he making any progress? Because I’d like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil.,Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" Yeah, he’s over it, that’s why he’s been whining all day about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black.",Raj,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" No, no, it’s fine. I don’t care. I’m over it.",Leonard,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 What’s wrong with you? You can’t hang out with your roommate’s ex. That’s totally uncool.,Howard,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 I was talking with Penny.,Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst

" Oh, it’s all right, I do. Oh! You’re in for what my mother calls a real Eye-talian treat. (Enters apartment).",Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 I don’t have hot dogs.,Penny,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce?,Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" Oh. Um, okay. Why don’t you give me an hour and come over?",Penny,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 Perhaps you’re getting a brain tumour.,Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 I definitely smell raw hot dog.,Howard,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" Oh, there it is, now that you don’t have a girlfriend, you want to hang out with me again.",Raj,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" What about you, Raj?",Leonard,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" Nah, I can’t. I got to pick up my mom from her water aerobics class. 18 overweight women flapping their arm fat in a swimming pool. Looks like the manatee tank at Sea World.",Howard,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" So, you guys want to do something tonight?",Leonard,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" Certainly. It’s not like I have to moderate my food intake because I’m planning on eating again very shortly. Mm, mm, mm!",Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon?",Leonard,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 Jews don’t have hell. We have acid reflux.,Howard,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 Let me ask you a question. Do you believe you’re going to go to hell for eating sweet and sour pork?,Raj,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" Oh, God, this is good.",Howard,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 A few moments later.,Scene,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst

 I don’t know. Why?,Leonard,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" Just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs?",Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 Okay.,Leonard,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" Well, I do. Next to you, I’ll look like a catch.",Raj,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 And you think my presence will help with that?,Leonard,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" Hold on. Nope, no reason.",Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 Let’s go.,Howard,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 I can’t think of a reason why not.,Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 Or we could go together.,Howard,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" Oh, that’s not necessary. You can go first.",Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 Hold on. I’ll walk down with you.,Howard,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" I read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion, but increases serotonin, and you know me, if there’s one thing I like more than a refreshing beverage, it’s serotonin. Bye-bye.",Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" Yeah, since when do you take walks?",Howard,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 Since when do you take after-dinner walks?,Leonard,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" Ah, I do so love beverages. Now I think I’ll take my after-dinner walk.",Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" What, suddenly I’m not good enough for you?",Raj,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 You know what? I’ll just spend the evening alone.,Leonard,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" Excuse me, I’m thirsty, so I’m going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage.",Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 I wish you were Aquaman. Then I could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank.,Howard,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 I’m also pleased to report that he’s all cried out over you.,Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" Well, good.",Penny,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" No. I mean, I have no idea what you smell.",Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" Bye. Actually, I’m this way. Do I smell hot dogs?",Howard,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 I’m going the other way. Bye.,Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 I parked my scooter down the block.,Howard,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst

 Which way are you going?,Howard,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 Here Bubbles. Here boy.,voice,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" No, of course not. That would be odd and suspicious behavior.",Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" So what, you’re just gonna walk up and down the stairs?",Howard,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 I didn’t say outside.,Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 You said you were going for a walk.,Howard,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst

" All right, say hello to your mother for me.",Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 You can’t cook and you made me this.,Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst

" Well, I need a wingman. I don’t want to come off like a lonely loser.",Raj,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst

" Dude, I’m an astrophysicist. If there were solar flares, I’d be all up in it.",Raj,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" Oh, yes. In fact, he said, I’m fine, I don’t care. And he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal.",Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" So, um, was Leonard okay with you coming over?",Penny,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
" Mmm, mmm, mmm. That’s Eye-talian.",Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 Penny’s apartment.,Scene,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst

" I do, and you’ll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart. And she’ll take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces.",Leonard,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst

" Yes, but I rephrased it to avoid offending the hos.",Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 Is it possible he said Bros before Hos?,Leonard,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst
 I didn’t want to upset you. Howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money.,Sheldon,3.0,20.0,The Spaghetti Catalyst

 We broke up weeks ago.,Howard,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation

 What the frak?,Howard,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
" You two figure out the details, I’m going to go change into something I don’t mind getting ripped off my milky flesh.",Elizabeth,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
 Beg pardon?,Howard,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
" Not tonight. Tonight you are a delivery man. You brought soup, but uh-oh, Raj and I don’t have enough money to pay you. So we’ll have to come to some other kind of arrangement.",Elizabeth,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
" Yeah, sure. In fact, I’m a dungeon master.",Howard,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation

" Oh, good. It’s so much better when everyone commits.",Elizabeth,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
" Follow my lead. Almost. We’re, we’re going to go out into the hallway and, uh, make a dramatic entrance.",Raj,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
 Everybody ready?,Elizabeth,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
 I’m out.,Howard,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
 We’ll all be naked in front of each other.,Leonard,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
" Okay, show of hands. Who’s up for this? (Only Howard raises his hand.)",Raj,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
 Yep. Welcome to the Penthouse Forum.,Howard,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
 Is she suggesting what I think she’s suggesting?,Leonard,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
 What’s going on is you and Howard are my moving men and Raj is my new landlord and I don’t have enough money to pay any of you.,Elizabeth,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
 Elizabeth? What’s going on?,Leonard,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
 Good?,Raj,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
" Oh, good. Leonard’s here.",Elizabeth,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
" Oh, Penny, excellent. I have a question about these maxi pads. Are the wings truly functional or have I fallen victim to marketing hype?",Sheldon,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation

 I can’t believe they let him into Canada.,Raj,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
 I can’t believe he’s friends with Elizabeth Plimpton.,Leonard,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
" When I’ve seen two consecutive negative throat cultures spaced 12 hours apart. You know the drill. All right, if you’ll excuse me, I am off to start a prophylactic course of antibiotics.",Sheldon,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
 When can I sit with you again?,Raj,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
" Well, she doesn’t care for hotels. And who can blame her? Windows that don’t open, multi-user linens, keys shaped like credit cards, as if one walks around with unassigned slots in one’s wallet. All right, I believe I have time for one more question. Yes, Raj?",Sheldon,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
 Thank you. Why is a world-renowned scientist staying in our apartment instead of a hotel?,Leonard,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
 Yes. Bazinga. Leonard?,Sheldon,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
 So you’re saying the two of you are going to be sleeping in the same bed?,Howard,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
" A, I rarely kid. And B, when I do kid, you will know it by my use of the word bazinga.",Sheldon,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
" A, are you kidding me? And B, seriously, are you freaking kidding me?",Howard,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
 Go ahead.,Sheldon,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
" Yeah, um, I have a two-part question.",Howard,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
" When you say non-related female, you still mean human, right?",Leonard,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation

 What?,Raj,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
 Explain your sneeze.,Sheldon,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
 I’m sorry?,Raj,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
 Do you have allergies?,Sheldon,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation
 No.,Raj,3.0,21.0,The Plimpton Stimulation

 Yeah.,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation

" Excuse me, I’m looking for Sheldon Cooper’s apartment.",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 You are so naive. Just like I was seven years ago. (Flasback: The lobby) I’d just started at the university.,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Oh, I do not believe that.",Penny,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Believe it or not, he was worse when I met him.",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Well, not as nuts as the guy who chooses to live with him.",Penny,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" So you agree, he’s nuts.",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Apparently, the one fella tried to adjust the thermostat, then the other fella went bat-crap crazy.",Penny,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" You heard that, huh?",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Uh, well, you can try, but the people across the hall are being very noisy.",Penny,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Can I sleep on your couch tonight?,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Hang on.,Penny,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation

" I know what I said. I know what you said. I know what my mother said on March 5, 1992. What is the sixth noble gas?",Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 I’m Leonard Hofstadter. I called you about the apartment. You said…,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Yes?,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" In retrospect, that was clue number two.",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" No, you want the crazy guy across the hall.",Transvestite,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Dr. Cooper?,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Yeah?,Transvestite,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Sure, it makes sense now. (Flashback. Past Leonard is getting out of the lift). Anyway, I went upstairs and knocked on the door.",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation

 So Sheldon’s last roommate tried to warn you off?,Penny,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Moments later.,Scene,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 That should have been my first clue.,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Run fast, run far. (End of flashback.)",Man,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 What?,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Run away, dude.",Man,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 No! That’s where I sit!,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Okay.,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Each more daunting than the last. Have a seat.,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 There’s three?,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" No, but your ability to perceive their existence is conditional on you passing the second and third barriers.",Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" I don’t understand, their, their existence is conditional?",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 That depends.,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Oh, this is pretty nice. Uh, the bedrooms are back there?",whiteboards),3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Correct. You’ve passed the first barrier to roommate-hood. You may enter.,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Oh, uh, well, that’s tricky. Um, well, uh, Original Series over Next Generation, but Picard over Kirk.",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" All right, next question. Kirk or Picard?",Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Telling you? Telling you.,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Are you asking me or telling me?,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Uh, radon?",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 You said you’re a scientist. What is the sixth noble gas?,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 What?,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Why don’t you let me do this.,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Okay, I suppose I could drive you. Well that’s a point in my favour, right?",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 I can. I choose not to.,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Well, can’t you drive?",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 And you’ll be willing to drive me?,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" A car, yeah.",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 And you have a vehicle?,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Yes.,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Doesn’t concern you. You’ll be going to the university every day?,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 What is that?,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Hmm.,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Uh, yeah, experimental physics.",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Cathedra mea, regulae meae. That’s Latin for my chair, my rules. Now, you said on the phone that your area of study is physics.",Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Can you do that?,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" This seat is ideally located both in relation to the heat source in the winter and a cross breeze in the summer. It also faces the television at a direct angle allowing me to immerse myself in entertainment or game play without being subjected to conversation. As a result, I’ve placed it in a state of eternal dibs.",Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 What’s the difference?,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" No, this is my room. People don’t go in my room.",Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Is this it?,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Third barrier passed. You have won the right to see your room. Huzzah!,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Fine. I’ll take it.,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 I can’t give you eight. I can give you seven thirty.,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" I, I’m sorry, uh, in the morning. Around eight.",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" When you have to? I’m sorry, I don’t rent to hippies.",Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 When I have to.,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 This isn’t going to work if you’re guessing. When do you evacuate your bowels?,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Uh, I guess.",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 The second barrier. Don’t get cocky. This is the bathroom. Are you fairly regular?,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Oh, good. I passed the barriers.",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" That’s correct. FYI, I would have accepted any answer other than procreating. Come, I’ll show you the rest of the apartment.",Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Uh, I’m gonna go with preserving the knowledge.",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Last question. In a post-apocalyptic world, which task would you assign the highest priority? Locating a sustainable food source, re-establishing a functioning government, procreating, or preserving the knowledge of mankind?",Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Come on, I just asked.",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Why on earth did you agree to all that?,Penny,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Well that’s disappointing. (End of flashback.),Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Okay.,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Never fly it upside down unless the apartment’s in distress. And next, if either of us ever invents time travel, we agree our first stop will be this meeting today in precisely five seconds.",Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 We have a flag?,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" We might as well settle it now, it’s going to be on for years. Initial here. All right, that’s television and movies. Section nine, miscellany. The apartment’s flag is a gold lion rampant on a field of azure.",Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Does that really need to be in the agreement?,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Roommates agree that Friday nights shall be reserved for watching Joss Whedon’s brilliant new series Firefly.,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" No, I didn’t just move in. First we had to iron out a few details. (Flashback: The apartment)",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Okay, and after all that, you just moved in?",Penny,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Your room. You may want to repaint. (End of Flashback),Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 On occasion.,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Do you do this often?,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" If people don’t go in there, and you’re people, and… You are people, aren’t you? Making a joke.",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 I don’t understand.,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 So where do you sleep?,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Do I get some sympathy now?,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Oh, my God.",Penny,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 12 hours? (End of flashback.),Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" But, Joyce, come on.",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 That’s it! I’m out of here!,Kim,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 I didn’t even know her 12 hours ago.,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" You asked what I wanted. I wanted to come in. I’m here because you violated our roommate agreement. Specifically, section eight, visitors, subsection C, females, paragraph four, coitus. Roommates shall give each other 12 hours notice of impending coitus.”",Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 What do you want? I didn’t say come in!,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" I’m just going to keep knocking till you answer. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?",Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 I’m sure he’ll go away.,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?Leonard?",Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Shh. Just pretend we’re not here.,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?",Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Okay, how about this? Let me tell you about the first time I brought a girl over. (Flashback to Leonard’s bedroom.)",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Well, I’m sorry, Leonard, it’s very hard to feel sympathy for you.",Penny,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" It was the best apartment I’d seen, the rent was very reasonable and after you’ve passed the first three barriers you kind of want to take it all the way.",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" I can’t speak for these guys, but I’m sitting on my tushie. It’s a joke.",Howard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 I’ll get to you later. What are you sitting on?,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Hey.,Raj,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Hey.,Howard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Hey, Sheldon. This is Howard and Raj. They work at the university, too.",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 What is going on here?,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" It was, but one night, Sheldon came home from work… (Flashback, the apartment. The settee has now appeared. Leonard, Howard and Raj are playing a video game.)",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Oh, yeah, I’m wondering about that. You said it was working when you moved in.",Penny,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 That was part of it. The other part is what happened with the elevator.,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" So, what, that’s it? You’ve stayed with Sheldon all this time because he kept you from going to federal prison?",Penny,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" As it turns out, she was a North Korean spy. Luckily, Sheldon drove her out before I revealed anything important. Which I’m not saying I would have.",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 What does that have to do with Joyce Kim?,Penny,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Well, I was doing some government research at the time, you know, military, rocket fuel. It’s kind of secret.",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Why not?,Penny,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Actually, I couldn’t get too mad at him about Joyce Kim.",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" A little bit. Okay. Let me get this straight. You move in with this guy, he makes you sign a ridiculous roommate agreement, then he walks into your bedroom while you’re doing this Joyce Kim, and you still stay?",Penny,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Oh, yeah, I saw that. That was hilarious. (End of flashback.)",Raj,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" I put you there after you forwarded me a picture of a cat playing the piano, entitled this is funny.",Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 What am I doing in your spam folder?,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Oh, you did, did you? Oh, drat! Hoisted by my own spam filter.",Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 I did notify you.,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" But you didn’t notify me by e-mail, so this is still a breach.",Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" According to the roommate agreement, I’m entitled to allocate 50% of the cubic footage of the common areas.",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Did it occur to you that was by design?,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 They’re lawn chairs. And there was no place for company.,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 But what’s wrong with the furniture we have?,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Oh, well, there were some people on the first floor moving out, and they sold it to me for a hundred dollars. Howard and Raj helped me bring it up.",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Explain the couch.,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Hilarious.,Raj,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Right.,Howard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Tushie is buttocks, right?",Raj,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Yeah, not a good idea.",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Me, too.",Raj,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 I like it.,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Because no one likes Babylon 5.,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Why not?,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 We don’t watch Babylon 5 in this apartment.,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Ooh, it’s time for Babylon 5!",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Fine.,Raj,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 I don’t like this spot. I have to keep turning my head.,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Why?,Raj,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 It’s not an assumption. Change seats with me.,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 And you just assume you’re always right?,Howard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Yes.,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Okay, do you have an opinion about everything?",Raj,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" I assure you, you’ll be sorry you wasted your money on an iPod when Microsoft comes out with theirs.",Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 I’m getting to it. (Back to flashback.),Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Okay, what does all this have to do with the elevator?",Penny,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Why not?,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 You’re not going with us.,Howard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Wait. Let me get my jacket.,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Yeah, we can go over to my place.",Howard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 We can fix that. Let’s leave.,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Hmm, I’m still not comfortable. Of course. There’s too many people here.",Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Fine. And it’s a dickey.,Howard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 You’re protected by your turtleneck.,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" So, I get the draft?",Howard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 There’s a draft on my neck over here.,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Why?,Howard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 And I said yes. And I settle all ties. Change seats with me.,Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 But I said no to that.,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" They don’t get a vote. It’s one against one. And according to the roommate agreement, all ties will be settled by me.",Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 There you go– three against one.,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 So do I.,Howard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Oh, this just might be your lucky day.",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Oh, probably, if I could get my hands on that new fuel the government’s been working on.",Howard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Cool. Can it break Mach 1?,Raj,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Three. I designed the engine myself.,Howard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Oh, man. Is that a two-stage rocket?",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" She grows any more hair on her face, yes.",Howard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 That your dad?,Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" No, but if you keep screaming, maybe they’ll hear you!",Howard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Do their parents know they’re here?,Wolowitz,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 I don’t have playdates! I have colleagues!,Howard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Howard, are you having a playdate?",Wolowitz,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
 Fine. Go ahead. (Flashback to Howard’s bedroom.),Penny,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Hey, do you want me to finish working on your man feet or not?",Leonard,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Okay, how do you know he said that? You left the room.",Penny,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation
" Oh. Well, in that case, I don’t need my jacket. And for the record, the correct syntax is I’m the guy from whom you’re trying to get away. Oh, yes, this is definitely going to be my spot. (End of flashback.)",Sheldon,3.0,22.0,The Staircase Implementation

 Hello.,Sheldon,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 Whoa! Is that the laser? It’s bitchin’.,Zack,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" Yes. In 1917, when Albert Einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung, his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin’.",Sheldon,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" Well, mission accomplished.",Zack,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation

" No, it’s not.",Sheldon,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 Sheldon! Play nice.,Penny,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 Well it’s not a great question. How could somebody possibly think we’re going to blow up the moon? That’s a great question.,Sheldon,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" Don’t worry about the moon. We, we set our laser to stun.",Leonard,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 Smart.,Zack,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation

 That’s your big experiment? All that for a line on the screen?,Zack,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" Yeah, but, uh, think about what this represents. The fact that we can do this is the only way of definitively proving that there are man-made objects on the moon, put there by a member of a species that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane.",Leonard,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 What species is that?,Zack,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 I was wrong. Penny can do better.,Sheldon,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation

 Nope. Why don’t you ask him?,Howard,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" Leonard, what are you talking about?",Raj,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 I don’t want to talk about it.,Leonard,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 That was a lousy suggestion.,Raj,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" Whatever. Right now, Dr. Sheldon Cooper has to send an e-mail to his perfect match. Greetings, fellow life-form…",Howard,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 A building corridor.,Scene,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it. (Knocks on door) I can’t do it.",Leonard,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 Hello?,Winkle,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation

 Right. Right. So how you doing?,Leonard,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation

" Oh, God!",Penny,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 Yeah.,Leslie,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" Uh, do you, uh, want to do that again?",Leonard,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 What happened? Blondie dumped you?,Leslie,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 She didn’t dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.,Leonard,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 Right.,Leslie,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" Um, anyway, apparently, it’s okay to go back to people you’re no longer seeing and have recreational sex with them.",Leonard,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 Uh-huh.,Leslie,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" So, what do you say?",Leonard,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 Let me think about it. (Slams door.),Leslie,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 She’s not coming back.,Leonard,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 The apartment. ,Scene,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 Uh-oh. She wants to meet us.,Raj,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 Not us. Him.,Howard,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" Yes, but him doesn’t even know about her.",Raj,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" I’ll show you a picture of my Uncle Louie in a bathing suit sometime. Leonard, you gotta see this, we found a match for Sheldon.",Howard,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" Great. Maybe she can have sex with him, and then walk out on him the next morning without so much as a how do you do?",Leonard,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 Who’s going to tell whom about what?,Sheldon,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 Sheldon. Hey.,Howard,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 Hi.,Raj,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 Your surprise confuses me. I live here.,Sheldon,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" Right. So, listen, what are you doing tomorrow afternoon?",Howard,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 Be more specific.,Sheldon,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 Four thirty.,Howard,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 That’s not afternoon. That’s preevning.,Sheldon,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 What?,Howard,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 It’s a time of day I invented. It better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening. Preevning. I’m fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need.,Sheldon,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" Right, okay. What are you doing tomorrow preevning?",Raj,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" Well, tomorrow’s Saturday. Saturday night is laundry night, so I’ll be spending the preevning pre-sorting and pre-soaking.",Sheldon,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" Okay, what if I were to tell you, tomorrow, at 4:30 you could meet a woman who has been scientifically chosen to be your perfect mate?",Howard,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" I would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air, exhausted by your constant tomfoolery.",Sheldon,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 Fine. You?,Leslie,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" Uh, not bad. You remember when we used to have sex and you said that it didn’t mean anything, it was just for fun?",Leonard,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" And that’s exactly the answer we gave to the question, what is your attitude towards online dating”",Howard,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" Howard wanted to write mumbo jumbo, but I said no, our Sheldon would say hokum.",Raj,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" Well, come on, where’s your scientific curiosity?",Howard,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" Well, most of it is being applied to unravelling the secrets of the universe while the rest of it’s wondering why I’m having this conversation with you.",Sheldon,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" Okay, how about this. Even Spock had a date once every seven years.",Raj,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 He didn’t date. It was pon farr. His blood boiled with mating lust.,Sheldon,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" Okay, well, why don’t you start with a cup of coffee, and you can pon farr Amy Farrah Fowler later.",Howard,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 I don’t drink coffee.,Sheldon,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" All right, you can have a hot chocolate.",Howard,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" As I will not be engaging in this nonsense, my choice of beverage is moot. But for the record, I only drink hot chocolate in months with an R in them.",Sheldon,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 Why?,Howard,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 What’s life without whimsy?,Sheldon,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" Okay, I’m out.",Howard,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" Sheldon, I’ve hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment. Unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl, it will remain there forever.",Raj,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" Well, him about to find out about her.",Howard,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 Really? Us gonna tell him?,Raj,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" Hello, Amy Farrah Fowler. I’m sorry to inform you that you have been taken in by unsupportable mathematics designed to prey on the gullible and the lonely. Additionally, I’m being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock.",Sheldon,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" If that was slang, I’m unfamiliar with it. If it was literal, I share your aversion to soiled hosiery. In any case, I’m here because my mother and I have agreed that I will date at least once a year.",Amy,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
 Are you out of your mind?!,Penny,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
" Come on. We’re gonna have sex, and it’s not gonna mean a thing!",Leonard,3.0,23.0,The Lunar Excitation
