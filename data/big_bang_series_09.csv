 And you know why? ‘Cause you’re a man. The champagne of genders.,Sheldon,9.0,1.0,The Matrimonial Momentum
 I wouldn’t.,Leonard,9.0,1.0,The Matrimonial Momentum

 When can I stab one of my friends?,Sheldon,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 Yes.,Barry,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation

 This is easy. I didn’t need to wear a cup.,Leonard,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation

 I’m looking forward to him teaching us glove-slapping.,Sheldon,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation

 Later.,Scene,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 How dare you.,Sheldon,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 Of course. She deserves to be happy.,Leonard,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 You really think so?,Sheldon,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Look, even if it’s not him, Amy’s probably going to date someone at some point.",Leonard,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Yeah, but he’s dumb, and his face is dumb.",Sheldon,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Oh, buddy, I get that you don’t like it, but it’s not really up to you.",Leonard,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Well, that’s unacceptable.",Sheldon,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Oh. I hate to say it, but it sounds like he’s interested in her.",Leonard,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 Good to know? What’s that supposed to mean?,Sheldon,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 Weawwy? Good to know.,Barry,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Not that it’s any of your business, but she broke up with me.",Sheldon,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation

" Ah, this is fun.",Sheldon,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Well, that’s ’cause I’m doing that trick where you imagine the audience is naked. By the way, thumbs up, ladies.",Stuart,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Well, you’re talking to us now. I mean, you don’t seem nervous.",Penny,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Okay, fine. What, I mean, what can I do? I get so nervous around women.",Stuart,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 You can say it.,Amy,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 You are.,Bernadette,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 Yeah.,Penny,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" All right, I’m not saying it’s true, but let’s, let’s consider for a moment that possibly I’m the problem.",Stuart,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 The comic book store.,Scene,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Wow. That, that was crazier than I thought.",Leonard,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation

 And how are you gonna do that?,Barry,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation

 And now the crazy version of what I just said.,Leonard,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Barry, a word?",Sheldon,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Sheldon, instead of focusing on Amy dating other guys, maybe you should start thinking about dating another girl.",Howard,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" If you’re cranky and retaining water, I have a theory.",Leonard,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Look at this blister. Like it or not, we’re athletes now. Besides, a bar is where I belong. I’m having female problems.",Sheldon,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" I’m surprised you wanted to go to a sports bar, Sheldon.",Leonard,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 A sports bar.,Scene,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Suddenly, the rabbit thing makes sense.",Amy,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Okay, we’re all feeling it. Yes, I’ll go out with you.",Stuart,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Stuart, believe it or not, I understand. You know, before I met Sheldon, I was alone for a really long time. I was so desperate for people to like me, when I met these guys, it took everything in my power to hide my insecurity.",Amy,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" I mean, I can’t say for sure, but I swear that rabbit looked me right in the eye before it hopped in front of that car. Anyway, the longer I’m alone, the more desperate I get.",Stuart,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 That really happened?,Bernadette,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" I, I guess I assumed at this point in my life, I would be married or in a relationship, or even have a pet that didn’t run away or kill itself.",Stuart,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Okay. Don’t be offended, but, what went wrong with you?",Penny,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation

" I’m married, and I’m her grandmother.",woman,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Well, we gave it a shot. How about you?",Sheldon,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 I don’t know what that means.,Woman,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 It’s a Pokémon reference.,Sheldon,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 What?,Woman,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Excuse me. I’m recovering from a recent breakup, and I’m told asking out another woman might make me feel better. And as Ash Ketchum said to Pikachu, I choose you.",Sheldon,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Oh, boy.",Howard,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 Three.,Leonard,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 How many sips of that beer did he have?,Raj,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 You’re forgetting something. Ladies love jocks.,Sheldon,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Whoa, whoa. Walking up to a strange woman in a bar usually doesn’t work.",Raj,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" There’s that prostate doctor, but I’m still mad at her. Oh, there’s a woman. I’ll make her my girlfriend.",Sheldon,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 Maybe you should consider women who aren’t in serious relationships with your closest friends?,Leonard,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" True, but Penny’s married, and so is Bernadette. And your girlfriend has red hair and white skin, which really rubs up against my clown phobia.",Sheldon,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Why? You never thought you’d end up in a relationship, and then you met Amy. Maybe there’s someone else out there for you.",Raj,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 That’s ridiculous.,Sheldon,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" I don’t know. I guess I assumed that I would eventually date other people, but this is happening so fast.",Amy,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Well, what are you gonna do?",Penny,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Hi, how are you? I was wondering if you’d like to get a drink after work sometime.",Amy,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 What did he say?,Bernadette,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 I told you things would change if you plucked your eyebrows.,Penny,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Oh. Look at you, two guys in one day.",Bernadette,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 Barry Kripke just asked me out.,Amy,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation

" Huh. Well, this is weird.",sound),9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 And sometimes we marry them anyway.,Penny,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Oh, you get used to it. Some guys you have to turn down over and over.",Bernadette,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 I don’t have much experience turning men down. It wasn’t so much fun.,Amy,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation

 Hello.,Amy,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 I know it only takes one doctor’s finger.,Leonard,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation

 I don’t know.,Amy,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 Are you attracted to him?,Bernadette,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 I think she means not a weirdo.,Penny,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" You mean, not a scientist?",Bernadette,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Well, I was hoping the next person I dated would be a little less like Sheldon.",Amy,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 What can it hurt?,Bernadette,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Oh. Okay. Anyway, um, it’s nice to see you. You look good.",Amy,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 I’ve been told it’s a good way to move on.,Sheldon,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation

 I said no.,Amy,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation

" Well, actually, he, he already did.",Amy,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 It was pretty easy. And I think my background in mathletics helped. Barry Kripke was there. I should let you know that he expressed interest in asking you out.,Sheldon,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 How’d that go?,Amy,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 I’m doing all right. I tried fencing today.,Sheldon,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation

" Okay, show me en garde. Good. Knees bent, swightwy over the toe. Non-sword hand up for bawance.",Barry,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 He’s a righty.,Howard,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 Right. Always right.,Sheldon,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" When you’re in a public restroom, which foot do you flush the toilet with?",Howard,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Well, I’m not sure I have a dominant leg. They’re both pretty submissive.",Sheldon,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" What’s wong, Cooper?",Barry,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Oh, dear.",Sheldon,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 Awwight. Let’s begin with some fundamentals. This is the en garde position. Feet are in an L. Heels in a stwaight wine. Elbow is about a fist from the wib cage. Notice my dominant weg faces fowward.,Barry,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 Yeah. I already ran 18 miles today.,Howard,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 We’re not afraid of physical activity.,Sheldon,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation

" Ah, touché.",Sheldon,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 What about a game of tag on a French schoolyard?,Leonard,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" And as an added bonus, the word touché comes from fencing. It would be our only opportunity to use it in a non-metaphorical sense.",Sheldon,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 Preach.,Leonard,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Or worse, up.",Sheldon,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation

" Had me at flag, lost me at football.",Sheldon,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Oh, don’t worry. I, I’ve got a camera right up here, so I could watch from the counter and make sure guys aren’t being pervs. Anyway, so what do I got to do to, to get you in the door?",Stuart,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 Really? In a comic book store?,Penny,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation

He took it off and gave it to me.",Penny,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Eh, the Internet’s so negative. I try to avoid it.",Stuart,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Hey, have you read the online reviews for this place?",Penny,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Hmm, okay. Well, alright, what if I put up a sign in the window that said women, come in. Don’t be afraid.",Stuart,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation

 When was the last actual exercise you got?,Raj,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" Yeah, I can’t wait to see the look on her face when I die young.",Howard,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 That’ll teach her to care about your health.,Leonard,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
" No, Bernadette got me a Fitbit so she can track how much I’m exercising.",Howard,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation
 Is that the prototype drive system for the high-G rover?,Sheldon,9.0,5.0,The Perspiration Implementation

" Well, so how does it work?",Penny,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency
" Uh, well, it, it shows me all the single women in a five-mile radius who are using the app. If I like the way they look I hit thumbs up, if I don’t, thumbs down.",Stuart,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency

 We’d have to go to every Party City in California.,Leonard,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency
 Sounds like you on Cinco de Mayo.,Howard,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency
" Hey, people were still talking about that party on siete de Mayo.",Raj,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency
 That’s right. And what did he do?,Sheldon,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency
 He handed you the box directly and called you Stretch.,Leonard,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency
 It’s like it was yesterday.,Sheldon,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency
 Do you want liquid helium or not?,Leonard,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency

 Then I’m going to tell him we’re in.,Leonard,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency
" Leonard, wait. This is highly unethical.",Sheldon,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency
" We’re just bending the rules a little. We have grant money to do the experiment, so we’re going to spend it on the helium we need. It’s not like when Dr. Goldfarb claimed he bought an electron microscope and he was really just keeping a Russian girl in an apartment in Van Nuys.",Leonard,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency

 He’s using some kind of dating app on his phone.,Bernadette,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency
" Oh, which one? Maybe we can get Amy to try it.",Penny,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency

" Hmm, I don’t follow.",Man,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency
" Let me give you an example. Earlier today, I decoded the headers on your e-mail, and I know that your name is Kenneth Fitzgerald. From that, I figured out where you live and where you work. Now, to make this a Mexican standoff, I would say something like, uh, you give us the helium or I’ll turn you in to the authorities.",Sheldon,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency

" Yeah, exactly. See, you’re getting it.",Sheldon,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency

 Okay. It’s a shame about those scientists ripping you off. I expected a higher ethical standard from our friends in Sweden.,Man,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency
 It’s actually pretty common in our field. There’s not much you can do about it.,Leonard,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency

" Well, I never thought of it like that. Boy, frame of reference will just sneak up on you, won’t it?",Sheldon,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency
 My friend does make a decent point about the money. I don’t feel comfortable just handing it over up front.,Leonard,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency
" Ah, no money, no helium. Seems we’re at a, uh, stalemate.",Man,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency
" Not technically. In chess, a stalemate refers to a situation in which there are no remaining moves. Uh, you have plenty of moves available. You could beat us up and steal the money. You could kill us, you know. Really, you’re only limited by your imagination.",Sheldon,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency
" Huh. All these years I’ve been using stalemate, when I really mean impasse. I feel foolish.",Man,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency
 I don’t think it matters if this is a stalemate or an impasse or a Mexican standoff. What are we gonna do here?,Leonard,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency

 Really? What’s the hypothesis?,Man,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency
 Space-time can be interpreted as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.,Sheldon,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency
" Hmm. Could be, could be. Go on.",Man,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency
" Okay, but now there’s this Swedish team that read our paper and they’re trying to beat us to our own discovery. We really need this helium.",Leonard,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency
 What is it?,Leonard,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency
" It’s partially torn off, but the segment that remains reads property of and the letter U.",Sheldon,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency
 It’s probably USC or UCLA.,Leonard,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency
" Yeah, but what if it’s Property of U.S. Government? There’s a national helium reserve in Amarillo, Texas. If this was stolen from there, we’re accessories to a federal crime.",Sheldon,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency
 Let’s not jump to conclusions. A lot of things start with U.,Leonard,9.0,6.0,The Helium Insufficiency

" I think the same thing that appeals to people everywhere, the dream of a cold, rational world entirely without human emotion. Spock came from a planet governed only by logic. You know, on Vulcan, when your brother asks, why are you hitting yourself? the answer is, I’m not. You’re moving my arm. To which he says, Fascinating. And then you both watch educational television.",Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Aw. When he says things like that, I just want to hug him and make everything better.",Penny,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" My brother was mean to me, too.",Leonard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Yeah, you probably had it coming.",Penny,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Do you have any Spock collectibles?,Adam,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 I have many. My most treasured is an autographed napkin given to me by my very thoughtful friend Penny. That’s her over there.,Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Hi. Look at that. I’m in a movie, my shirt stayed on.",Penny,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Can we see the napkin?,Adam,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Of course. Excuse me. This will just take a moment.,Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Oh. Making myself a bologna sandwich like my mom used to make me after my dad left, but before she died.",Howard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 When there was no more room in the floor safe.,Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 When did we get a floor safe?,Leonard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 When we got the security camera.,Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 There’s a security camera?,Leonard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Aquaman, protecting your home since 2012.",Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Oh, my God. We’ve done things on that couch.",Penny,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Yeah. You don’t have to tell me.,Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Scene,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" So, your father-in-law is in there right now?",Raj,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Yes. So back me up. The house is good the way it is.,Howard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Oh, okay. Got it.",Raj,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Hey. What’s going on?,Howard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Hey.,Raj,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Hey, Raj. Dad and I were just talking about taking down this wall.",Bernadette,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 You sure? It’s a pretty great wall.,Raj,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 A few years.,Wil,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 I’m sorry. I did what I could.,Raj,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Seriously? You brought Raj over to take your side?,Bernadette,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Your dad’s on your side.,Howard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 He’s not on my side. He’s doing all the work for free.,Bernadette,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 That is so generous of you. I’d like to switch sides.,Raj,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Look, uh, I don’t even think you can take this wall down ’cause it’s load-bearing.",Howard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Well, it’s easy to find out. Just go into the crawlspace under the house and check.",Raj,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 When is your visa up?,Howard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 The apartment.,Scene,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Not only is it signed to me but this is where he wiped his mouth. So we are currently in the presence of Leonard Nimoy’s DNA.,Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Um, doesn’t Adam count as Leonard Nimoy’s DNA?",Wil,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" No offence, but this is pure 100% Nimoy. Because of your mother, you’re only 50%. Which isn’t bad, but anything that you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away.",Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Okay, enough about the napkin. What else you hiding in there?",Penny,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Wouldn’t you like to know?,Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 I would.,Penny,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 When did we get a wall safe?,Leonard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 You have a will?,Leonard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Yeah. My 1/18 scale Wil Wheaton action figure. I also have the other kind of will, and in it I will my Wil back to Wil.",Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Will Wil want it?,Leonard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Wil won’t.,Wil,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Oh, what’s that ring box?",Penny,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Oh. That is an engagement ring that I was going to give my girlfriend Amy.,Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 What?,Penny,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 You bought her a ring?,Leonard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" No, no. This has been in my family for generations. Except for a short time when Comanches cut off my great-great-great-grandmother’s finger and stole it.",Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Sheldon, that’s awful.",Wil,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" No. The Texas Rangers tracked them down to their village and slaughtered every last one of them. It was a happy ending. Well, for my nine-fingered Nana.",Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Okay, back to the ring. Does Amy even know about this?",Penny,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 No. She broke up with me before I could broach the subject.,Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Oh, man, I’m sorry, that must have been devastating for you.",Leonard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" No, not at all. No, I’m fine. You know, Amy had reservations about our relationship, so all worked out for the best.",Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 What’s so great about it?,Rostenkowski,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" I said I’m fine! (Long pause) We’ve gotten a little off-topic. Allow me to make things entertaining again in this little Spockumentary. That was Leonard’s joke. As a child, when faced with a dilemma, my mother encouraged me to ask what would Jesus do? The answer to that was always love thy neighbour. But my neighbour had a dead tooth, so that wasn’t going to happen. But that’s why I changed it to, what would Spock do?",(shouting),9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Did you find that helpful?,Adam,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Yes. Oh, for example, three years ago when I discovered Penny was eating all my Pop-Tarts, instead of getting angry or vindictive, you know, I got a floor safe.",Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 I knew I could smell ’em.,Penny,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 What about from when you were a kid?,Adam,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Oh, certainly. Uh, when I was eight years old, Billy Sparks cornered me in the playground. I asked myself what would Spock do? Then I grabbed Billy on his shoulder and performed my first Vulcan nerve pinch.",Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Did it work?,Adam,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Oh, no, he broke my collarbone. I can still hear it click.",Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 That must have been very upsetting for you.,Adam,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Oh, not at all. As I said, the entire point of emulating Spock was to rise above human emotion, which I’ve spent a lifetime mastering.",Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Oh pfft.,Penny,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Excuse me?,Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 I’m sorry. I’m not here.,Penny,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 No. You went pfft. What does pfft mean?,Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Um.,Penny,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" All right then. See? Just my valuables. My passport, uh, my will.",Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" All right, fine. Well, Sheldon, I’m no expert, but aren’t you completely missing the point of Spock? I mean, he liked to act like he had no emotions, but he was still half human.",Penny,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Just like you.,Leonard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" I’m just saying, you pretend you don’t, but you have feelings just like everybody else.",Penny,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Not true. No, look at me. I had an engagement ring to give a girl, and instead, she rejected me. And am I emotional about that? No. No, I am sitting here on a couch, talking about my favourite TV character like nothing happened. ‘Cause I am just like him, all logical, all the time.",Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Sweetie, you’re yelling.",Penny,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Because when I speak at a regular volume, no one seems to believe me that I’ve put this Amy nonsense behind me.",Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 This documentary is gonna be awesome.,Wil,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 The crawlspace under Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Scene,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 You gonna be okay down here?,Rostenkowski,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Yeah. Yeah, I feel like an archaeologist. Indiana Jones and the Single-Family Dwelling. Hey. Look. Found a seashell.",Howard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Yeah, that’s a rat skull.",Rostenkowski,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Oh.,Howard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Relax. There’s enough droppings down here without you making more.,Rostenkowski,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Sorry. Do you have a sense of where we are?,Howard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Yeah. I think that’s the den.,Rostenkowski,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 I know. It just…,Penny,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Uh-huh. Yep. You know, I know you don’t want to hear this, but it wouldn’t take that much work to turn that den into a nursery.",Rostenkowski,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Why wouldn’t I want to hear it?,Howard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 ‘Cause Bernie said you didn’t want kids.,Rostenkowski,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" That’s not true at all. I wish she’d get pregnant, believe me. I’m climbing on top of her every chance I get. In a loving and respectful manner. The point is, I really do want kids.",Howard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Huh.,Rostenkowski,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" I don’t know why she’s lying to you. She’s the one who doesn’t want kids. In fact, every time I bring up the subject…",Howard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance

 I know. I also can’t believe he watched what we did on that couch and still sits on it.,Leonard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Yeah.,Penny,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Hello.,Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Hey, buddy. How you doing?",Leonard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 You did go pfft.,Leonard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Yeah.,Leonard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Do you think they’re going to put my outburst in the documentary?,Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Oh, yeah.",Leonard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Definitely.,Penny,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Well, there’s no point in dwelling on it. As the Vulcans say, Kup-fun-tor ha’kiv na’ish Du stau.",Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Do you know what that means?,Penny,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 No.,Leonard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Are you telling the truth?,Penny,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Nirsh.,Leonard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Well, this is ridiculous. Being upset about Amy all the time isn’t accomplishing anything. If I want to resolve this situation, then I need to take action.",Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 What are you gonna do?,Penny,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" I’m going to find her and ask her to marry me. And if she says yes, we can put this behind us and resume our relationship. And if she says no, well, then she can just ponfo miran.",Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 He didn’t meant that.,Leonard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Scene,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 So I should probably explain why I kind of fibbed.,Bernadette,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Oh. Okay, so we must be under the dining room.",Howard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 I told my dad that you were the one who didn’t want kids because I didn’t want to disappoint him.,Bernadette,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 But you were okay throwing me under the bus?,Howard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Turns out yeah, I didn’t think twice about it.",Bernadette,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Bernie, you don’t need to worry about me. But I don’t want to see you miss out. Raising children was the most rewarding experience of my life.",Rostenkowski,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Oh, please. Mom did everything. All you did was come home from work, sit on the couch and drink beer. How is that raising kids?",Bernadette,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" This is really a conversation for husband and wife. I’m gonna go clean up, hit the road. If your mother asks, I was here till ten.",Rostenkowski,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" It’s interesting your father didn’t help around the house and Howard doesn’t help, either, so in a way, Howard’s not only like your father, but he’s also like the child that you’re afraid to have.",Raj,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Why are you still here?,Howard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Fine, I’ll leave. But it sounds like somebody needs a fresh diaper.",Raj,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" All right, I admit that I don’t help out a lot. And I need to work on that. But if we had a kid, it would be different.",Howard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Why?,Bernadette,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Because when my dad left, I promised myself that if I ever had a chance to be a father I’d always be there.",Howard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Okay, I’ll think about it.",Bernadette,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" And this an actual I’ll think about it, not like the can we get a motorcycle with a sidecar I’ll think about it”?",Howard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 It’s an actual I’ll think about it.,Bernadette,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Better. Did Wil and Adam leave?,Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 I know you would.,Bernadette,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance

 Because she feels. I don’t. All I know is logic.,screen),9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Yeah, right. You can just shut your feelings off. There goes television, lying to us again. We let you raise our children, and this is the thanks we get. Leonard, how could I have been so foolish to try and follow in the footsteps of a made-up alien race with no emotions?",Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Well now instead of idolizing fictional characters, you can focus on the real people who are already in your life.",Leonard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Those are very wise words.,Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Thank you.,Leonard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 They’d just be so much more comforting if they came out of a television.,Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 That would be nice.,Howard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Listen to this. I just received an e-mail from Wil Wheaton. Leonard Nimoy’s son is working on a documentary that he started with his father before he passed away. It’s about Mr. Spock and his impact on our culture.,Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Why is he writing to you?,Leonard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Well, they’re looking for fans to interview, and Wil thought I’d be good for it.",Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Oh. Hey, high five.",Raj,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
" Absolutely not. Yeah, Penny, you spent some time in front of the camera. Any words of advice?",Sheldon,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Yes. Don’t take your shirt off just because the director said so.,Penny,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 I really believe I’d be a great dad.,Howard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance

 I’m listening.,Howard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 Let’s just redo one room and see how it goes.,Bernadette,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 That is reasonable. But what room?,Howard,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance
 How ’bout this one?,Bernadette,9.0,7.0,The Spock Resonance

" I’ll start you off easy. Electric eel, pufferfish, shrimp.",Sheldon,9.0,9.0,The Platonic Permutation

 Okay. Sure.,Amy,9.0,9.0,The Platonic Permutation
" Hey, let’s not pull at that thread. Okay. I’ll fight SpongeBob, because he’s so friendly we’ll just end up tickling each other.

A straitjacket, ’cause 72’s the best and you’re crazy. Now, this is your spot. You’re very protective of it. When anyone else tries to sit here, you berate them relentlessly. It sounds mean, but somehow you make it adorable. People are also delighted by your love of pranks. For example, Leonard has no idea what I did to his coffee. It wasn’t replace it with Folger’s crystals, I’ll tell you that much.",Sheldon,9.0,10.0,The Earworm Reverberation

" Yeah, maybe that is something. How did you find that?",Raj,9.0,12.0,The Sales Call Sublimation

 It could be a trans-Neptunian object.,Raj,9.0,12.0,The Sales Call Sublimation
 Maybe it’s a new planet.,Sheldon,9.0,12.0,The Sales Call Sublimation
" Unlikely, but it could be a dwarf planet.",Raj,9.0,12.0,The Sales Call Sublimation

" Yeah, no one cares. Did you help me out or not?",Penny,9.0,12.0,The Sales Call Sublimation
 Ignore him. He’s just using humour to express how happy he is.,Bernadette,9.0,12.0,The Sales Call Sublimation

" Well, I was thinking a home theatre or a gaming room, you know, like a man cave.",Howard,9.0,12.0,The Sales Call Sublimation
 Why can’t it be a woman cave?,Bernadette,9.0,12.0,The Sales Call Sublimation
" As long as it has a home theatre, a video game system and you’re not allowed in it, you can call it whatever you want.",Howard,9.0,12.0,The Sales Call Sublimation

 I suppose it could end up on a collision course with Earth and destroy life as we know it.,Sheldon,9.0,12.0,The Sales Call Sublimation
 Too busy to call? He wasn’t too busy to binge-watch Hot in Cleveland with my Hulu password. What is happening? Are we missing him?,Howard,9.0,12.0,The Sales Call Sublimation
" No, that’s not what this feeling is. Is it?",Bernadette,9.0,12.0,The Sales Call Sublimation
 Of course not. He drove us crazy. Like when you were gonna make that pie and Stuart ate all the blueberries.,Howard,9.0,12.0,The Sales Call Sublimation
" And he tried to deny it, but his teeth were all purple.",Bernadette,9.0,12.0,The Sales Call Sublimation

 That’s a great idea. I’ve got it. We’ll call it Cooper.,Sheldon,9.0,12.0,The Sales Call Sublimation
" Okay, now, what I’m hearing is that you feel that I sometimes take too long to express myself, and you wish I’d be more succinct.",Leonard,9.0,12.0,The Sales Call Sublimation

 I’ll give it to him next time I see him.,Howard,9.0,12.0,The Sales Call Sublimation
 Have you heard from him since he left?,Bernadette,9.0,12.0,The Sales Call Sublimation
 No. You’d think he would’ve called once he got settled in.,Howard,9.0,12.0,The Sales Call Sublimation
 Hmm. Maybe he’s busy.,Bernadette,9.0,12.0,The Sales Call Sublimation
 Exactly. See how well we work together?,Sheldon,9.0,12.0,The Sales Call Sublimation

" Nice to meet you, too.",Meemaw,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 It’s my first time. I’m looking for inspiration for this movie I’m writing.,Claire,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 You’re a screenwriter?,Howard,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" Well, screenwriter, slash bartender, slash, a month away from living in my car.",Claire,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" Yeah, I get that. I’m a scientist, slash party planner, slash small-dog enthusiast, slash guy who probably should have stopped at scientist.",Raj,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 You’re really a scientist?,Claire,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" Well, astrophysicist.",Raj,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 That’s perfect. Do you think I could pick your brain for my movie some time? It’s animated sci-fi for kids.,Claire,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 Sure. I love animated movies.,Raj,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" He does, and he has the Lilo & Stitch collector plates to prove it.",Howard,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 Excuse me for wanting a little magic in my life.,Raj,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" If I did, would I find any?",Sheldon,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 Maybe. But you also might find my brassieres and bloomers.,Meemaw,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 That’s a risk I’m willing to take.,Sheldon,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" Well, this is so nice. He’s so excited to have you here and…",Amy,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" Okay, now let’s you and me get something straight. He may think that I came to bake him cookies, but the real reason is to size you up.",Meemaw,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" S, s, si, size me up?",Amy,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" So, how do you think she’d feel about you helping a beautiful girl with her screenplay?",Howard,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 I wouldn’t say she’s beautiful.,Raj,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 Really? You don’t think she’s attractive?,Howard,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 I do. I just wouldn’t tell my girlfriend.,Raj,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 The apartment.,Scene,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" Constance, are you sure I can’t pour you some wine?",Penny,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" Oh, no wine for me. Sheldon’s bringing me my whiskey.",Meemaw,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" Here you go, Meemaw. I made it just how you like, a lot in a glass.",Sheldon,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" Thank you, Moon Pie.",Meemaw,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 I’m curious. Why do you call Sheldon Moon Pie?,Amy,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 I’ll take your word for it.,Girl,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 You should. He’s really looked.,Howard,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" I’m Raj, by the way. This is Howard.",Raj,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 Hi.,Howard,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation

 Yeah.,Sheldon,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" So, Penny, I understand you have a new job.",Meemaw,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 Yes. I’m a pharmaceutical sales rep.,Penny,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 Oh. It’s so wonderful that you modern gals can have it all. A husband and a full-time career.,Meemaw,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" I have a relationship and a full-time career, too.",Amy,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 That doesn’t bode well.,Meemaw,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" Why not? You, you just said it’s okay for her to work.",Amy,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" Well, Leonard doesn’t need as much tending to as Sheldon does. And as Moon Pie explained, Leonard’s work is more of a hobby.",Meemaw,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 That’s my best friend.,Leonard,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" Here’s my number. Give me a call, we’ll get together.",Claire,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation

 So?,Raj,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You have to like each other. Well, we have a 4:30 reservation at Applebee’s.",Sheldon,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 I think I should leave.,Amy,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" But why? Other than you two fighting, we’re having such a good time.",Sheldon,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" The minute you left the room, your precious meemaw started giving me a really hard time. I don’t need this.",Amy,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 Let her go. And under no circumstance will you give her that engagement ring.,Meemaw,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 What ring?,Amy,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 Maybe we should give them some privacy.,Leonard,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" Yeah, yeah, yeah. You go ahead. I’ll catch up with you.",Penny,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 You have an engagement ring?,Amy,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 Yes.,Sheldon,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 ‘Cause he’s so nummy-nummy.,Meemaw,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 She could just eat him up.,Penny,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" And I call her Meemaw because, well, just, well, look at her.",Sheldon,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 It’s interesting that Leonard and Penny know about his nickname and you don’t.,Meemaw,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" Oh, well, you know, now, now that I’m hearing it, it does sound familiar.",Amy,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" How could it? I never told you, and you never bothered to ask.",Sheldon,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" Oh, I don’t think I could do that.",Sheldon,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" Sheldon, tell this girl that my ring will never be on her finger.",Meemaw,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" I’m gonna opt out of that one, too.",Sheldon,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" Who said I even want to be engaged to him? And if I do, I, I don’t need your hand-me-downs.",Amy,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" All right, all right, look, l, let’s all, let’s remain calm and analyse this situation. Now, I realize that you’ve only known each other for less than a day, but is it possible this crankiness is because your cycles have synced?",Sheldon,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 You leave the room and let the grown-ups talk. Now.,Meemaw,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 Don’t speak to him like he’s a child.,Amy,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation

" I appreciate your honesty, dear.",Meemaw,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 Thank you.,Amy,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 And here’s some more honesty. I don’t like you very much.,Meemaw,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" Well, maybe I don’t like you either.",Amy,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" Not you. I own your ass. The real question is, where are you with Emily?",Bernadette,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" Uh, it’s hard to say. I think we’re good, but things like this make me wonder if Emily’s really the right person for me. I mean, did you guys ever have doubts about each other?",Raj,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 No. Never.,Howard,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation

" Fine. I had reservations about you, too.",Howard,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" No, you didn’t.",Bernadette,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation

" Well, it doesn’t matter now, ’cause I love how things worked out.",Bernadette,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" Penny, did you know about this?",Amy,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" All right, let’s go.",Penny,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation

" Well, thank goodness for that.",Meemaw,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" Sheldon, will you please tell your grandmother to stay out of this?",Amy,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 Come in.,Penny,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 Hey. What happened? Is Amy gone?,Leonard,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 No. They asked me to leave so they could speak privately.,Sheldon,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 Uh-oh.,Penny,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation

 Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Scene,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" All right. I’ve made up my mind. I’m gonna do the right thing, call this girl, and let her know that I’m in a relationship.",Raj,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" Okay, so far we’ve heard, made up my mind I’m dumping Emily.",Howard,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 Made up my mind to date both of them by pretending to be twin brothers.,Bernadette,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" And made up my mind, I’ll ask for a threesome and if they say no, play it off as a joke.",Howard,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 Just to help her with her screenplay.,Raj,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" Oh. Well, I guess that’s not so bad.",Bernadette,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 You weren’t there. He was really flirting.,Howard,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" Hey, it’s not my fault if American women project their fantasies on foreigners with the kind of magical voice that grants wishes.",Raj,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 I’m sure it was harmless. People flirt. No big deal.,Bernadette,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 Really? So it’s okay if I fl…,Howard,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 Okay. Good for you.,Claire,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation

" Sure, we had a vibe.",Claire,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" I knew it. Okay, we did have a vibe. This is exciting. What’s my next move?",Raj,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation

" Yeah, right in there. She ate it and everything.",Penny,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation

 I did.,Meemaw,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" Yeah, well, that is exactly what I’ve been doing the last five years with this little work in progress.",Sheldon,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" He never disappoints, does he?",Leonard,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 I think what Sheldon means to say is we’ve both grown together. Isn’t that right?,Amy,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 Well…,Sheldon,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 Hang on. We’re both adults. We can still get together without it meaning anything.,Claire,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation

" Hey, did you ever tell Emily about us?",Claire,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 I will.,Raj,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 There were days I wanted to fill his pockets with corn and toss him in the pigpen.,Meemaw,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" Well, if you understand, then why are you giving me such a hard time?",Amy,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
" Because when you broke up with Sheldon, it hurt him deeply, and I don’t want to see that happen again.",Meemaw,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation

" If I’m going to jail, I’m killing him, not breaking his thumb.",Leonard,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation
 Yeah.,Penny,9.0,14.0,The Meemaw Materialisation

" Well, you made my last birthday so memorable, I wanted to return the favour.",Amy,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" I do, but why do you care if I celebrate my birthday at all?",Sheldon,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 But it’s the one day a year that’s just all about you.,Amy,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Please, look at this porcelain skin. I’m like a human sink.",Sheldon,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Uh, Mylar balloons, yes. Latex balloons, no. Water balloons, I will jump off the roof and aim for your car.",Sheldon,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Okay, so how do you feel about party balloons?",Amy,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 The apartment.,Scene,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation

 He is?,Leonard,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Sure, uh, but just so you know, he’s kind of a diva.",Stuart,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 Sheldon?,Amy,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation

 The apartment. ,Scene,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Well, where’s that information been this whole time?",Leonard,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" W, wait a minute. You mention his birthday and he vanishes?",Penny,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Okay, great, I mean, it doesn’t have to be a big party or anything. I was just, where’d he go?",Amy,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Oh, I suppose that’s a discussion we could have.",Sheldon,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Well, your birthday’s coming up, and you’ve never let us celebrate it, and I was hoping maybe this year we could.",Amy,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation

 The comic book store.,Scene,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Okay, sweetie, we’re on the clock here. Can you hate yourself and frost at the same time?",Penny,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Oh, I, I was just glad to be invited. To be honest, I don’t always feel like I’m part of the group.",Stuart,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Thank you so much for helping us, Stuart.",Penny,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 The apartment.,Scene,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 Don’t say that to anyone.,Leonard,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" What? He beat out George Clooney, and that’s something. Like, I love me some Clooney.",Raj,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 You realize none of those things would happen now?,Amy,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" When I was six, they told me Batman was coming to my party. I waited by the door for hours. Closest thing to Batman I saw was when a robin flew into the window.",Sheldon,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Oh, poor thing.",Penny,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Oh, that part wasn’t so bad. I didn’t like them, either. But then I’d inevitably spend the whole day being tortured by my sister’s friends.",Sheldon,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 I’m sorry.,Amy,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Fine. As you know, I have a twin sister with whom I obviously share a birthday. Every year we’d have a party. No one I invited would ever come, because they didn’t like me.",Sheldon,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 Can you please just tell me why?,Amy,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 One day. Right.,Leonard,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 I enjoy marching bands and Tibetan throat singing.,Sheldon,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" All right, what about music?",Penny,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" I’m sold, you’re ahead of Bale.",Leonard,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" I never had to say I’m Batman. I showed up, people knew I was Batman. Everywhere I went, on the TV show, mall openings, Julie Newmar’s bungalow.",Adam,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Really? You’re ahead of Bale? The man who personified the words, I’m Batman.",Howard,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Oh, if you’re gonna factor in a sense of humour, then I should be at the top of the list. It should be me, Keaton, Kilmer, Lego, Bale, and that pretty boy Clooney.",Adam,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 Thank you. That’s why I say Keaton’s number one. He brought a sense of humour to the role.,Raj,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Oh, please. Even my poodles know Bale’s overrated.",West,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 Can I get his contact info?,Leonard,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Yeah, but there was kind of a scheduling conflict. He, uh, wanted to know when he’d get paid. And I wouldn’t tell him.",Stuart,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Or a real Batman. Hey, Stuart? Didn’t you try to get Adam West to do a signing here once?",Leonard,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" You mean, some guy in a lame suit?",Raj,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 Maybe we could get Batman to actually show up.,Leonard,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 That’s funny. Let’s do that.,Howard,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Well, just don’t get anything Jurassic. He feels like that whole chunk of time has gone Hollywood. Hey, uh, you know, he told a sad story about how his sister tricked him into thinking Batman was coming to his party.",Leonard,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 He’s been fascinated with dinosaurs lately. Maybe we could get him a fossil.,Raj,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" No, no, no. Come on in.",Bernadette,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Hewwo, I hope I’m not too earwy.",Barry,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation

 The apartment.,Scene,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 But this is my birthday suit. Are you having a stroke? Because that’s the kind of thing that just ruins a birthday party.,Sheldon,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Maybe later I’ll, uh, get to see you in your birthday suit.",Amy,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 Oh. Thank you.,Sheldon,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 Don’t say that to him.,Howard,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" You know, Adam West is my favourite Batman? Well, after Michael Keaton, Christian Bale and Batman from The Lego Movie.",Raj,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Uh, nice guy. But it was a little weird to hear Batman say don’t ring the doorbell or my poodles will go crazy.",Leonard,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Hey, so what was Adam West like on the phone?",Raj,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 Leonard’s car.,Scene,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Well, my favourite is chocolate with strawberry frosting, three layers, and if there’s writing on it, make sure it’s not all caps. I don’t need my dessert yelling at me.",Sheldon,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 What kind of cake do you like?,Bernadette,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 No music it is.,Penny,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 Can we just all agree we’re worried about Affleck?,Howard,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" There’s another reason I should be higher on the list. All those other guys had muscles built into their costumes. All I had in my Batsuit was 100%, grade-A West.",Adam,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 Batman finally came to your party.,Leonard,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation

" No. No, if I can walk past that pet shop with the parrot in the window, I suppose I can do this.",Sheldon,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 Are you crazy? How can you put Michael Keaton in front of Christian Bale?,Leonard,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 Leonard’s car.,Scene,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Yeah, birthday party first. Pity party later.",Penny,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 Sounds like something a member of the group might know.,Stuart,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 Yeah.,Bernadette,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" You, you’re pregnant?",Stuart,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 Doing great.,Bernadette,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 And how is the wadiant mommy-to-be?,Barry,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Oh, I wouldn’t call it a party. Just a few close friends. And your sister and brother.",Beverley,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 Oh. You had a party for your 60th?,Leonard,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" I get that. Hey, you want to just bring a few people in here? You know, Wil Wheaton in the bathtub, Batman on the toilet. It’ll be like the weirdest Comic-Con ever.",Penny,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" I don’t know. I looked around the room, and I saw all the faces and the presents, and it, it was just too much.",Sheldon,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Because you e-mail me your bathroom schedule once a week, even though I’ve clicked unsubscribe, like, a thousand times. So, what’s going on?",Penny,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 How do you know I’m not using the facilities?,Sheldon,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Okay, this is ridiculous. (Knocking) Sheldon? Can I come in?",Penny,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Again, no…",Leonard,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Well, I’m, I’m sure they’ll ask you to give a speech, and that’s when you just tear ’em a new one. Have to say, you, you do look good in that suit.",Amy,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 But who’s gonna tell them they’re doing it wrong?,Sheldon,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Well, I think they just want you to see it for the first time all decorated.",Amy,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 Is there a reason I had to leave my own apartment?,Sheldon,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 Penny’s apartment.,Scene,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation

" You know, to be fair, we did get married in Vegas and didn’t invite her.",Penny,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Oh, pl, you’re not ruining it. Look, at some point, Raj will try to get everyone to do the Electric Slide. Now, that will ruin it.",Penny,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 I know that you worked hard to put this together. I’m sorry I’m ruining it.,Sheldon,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation

" Sheldon, I know that we’ve had our ups and downs, but I can honestly say that my life is so much more interesting because you are in it. We may have met because you are a fan of Star Trek. But I have become a fan of Sheldon Cooper. Live long and prosper, buddy. And happy birthday.",Wil,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Little generic. Keep thinking. We’ll circle back. Wil Wheaton, go.",Sheldon,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation

" Well, I’ve, you know, seen him without pants on.",Amy,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" No offence, but I’ve known the guy a really long time.",Leonard,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Well, don’t you think I’m the one who should go in?",Amy,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation

" Well, everyone will think I’m weird.",Sheldon,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" My point is, there was a time I never would’ve been friends with someone like you, and now you are one of my favourite people. So, if what you need is to spend your birthday in a bathroom, I’m happy to do it with you.",Penny,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Based on this pep talk, I’d say you’re still doing it.",Sheldon,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" That’s fine. You know, I hate that your sister and her friends used to torture you. But what I hate even more is, if I was there, I would have tortured you, too.",Penny,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 I don’t think I can go back out there.,Sheldon,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation

 I’m sorry I brought it up.,Amy,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Just one example of how birthdays can be terrible. Now, can we please drop this subject and pick a new one? I suggest how thick can a soup get before it becomes a stew? You know, the answer, it may surprise you.",Sheldon,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
" Oh, my God.",Penny,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation
 Surprise.,Sheldon,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation

" Hello, everyone. I, I’d like to apologize for my behaviour. I hope it hasn’t put a damper on the party. So, please, enjoy yourselves. Oh, this is quickly getting out of hand.",Sheldon,9.0,17.0,The Celebration Experimentation

 See what?,Amy,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" I hadn’t spoken to Emily since I broke up with her, and she left this on my doorstep with a note.",Raj,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Raj, I got you this before we split up, but couldn’t return it and thought you’d like to have it. Happy belated Valentine’s Day, Emily.",Penny,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 That’s nice.,Bernadette,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Get a load of this guy.,Sheldon,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Can you imagine if we make money with this?,Howard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Why wouldn’t you open it?,Amy,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Well, she was pretty mad. For all I know it’s a voodoo doll of me with a fork stuck in my junk.",Raj,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" You don’t think she’d actually send you something gross or dangerous, do you?",Bernadette,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 I know one way to find out. Sniff this.,Penny,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" She’s pregnant, she’s not a bloodhound.",Amy,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Although I am getting a little machine oil. I think it’s metal.,Bernadette,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Come on, just open it.",Penny,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" You know, on Game of Thrones, Balon Greyjoy received his son’s genitals in a box.",Raj,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Well, never hurts to have a spare.",Penny,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 What is that?,Bernadette,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Wow. It’s an antique sextant. Sailors used these to find their position by the stars.,Raj,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 What a nice gift for an astrophysicist.,Amy,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" I know, she’s so thoughtful.",Raj,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" See, she’s trying to get you back. Now, that is exactly what I would’ve gotten you if I had any idea what it is or what you do.",Penny,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Sorry, but we can’t sign this.",Leonard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Come on, let’s go.",Howard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 The apartment.,Scene,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Well, what if we go around the university and just get the patent ourselves?",Leonard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" We can’t. It says on their Web site, as long as we work there, they have a controlling ownership of anything we come up with.",Howard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Great, so they own my idea for a T-shirt that says Dumb as a Bag of Geologists.",Sheldon,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Well, our choices are we do this with the university or we don’t do it at all.",Leonard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Either way, I get nothing.",Howard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Or, if we ended up making money from this, Sheldon and I could split our shares with you.",Leonard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" To be clear, Leonard is referring to the gyroscope, not the T-shirt and mugs. Oh, now they own the mugs.",Sheldon,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 I guess that is a way around this. You guys would be cool doing it like that?,Howard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Of course, we can split any profits three ways.",Leonard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 I’m fine with that.,Sheldon,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Okay, great.",Howard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" It sounds like a, uh, contract might be in order.",Sheldon,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Sure, we could write something up.",Leonard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Nice, or is she trying to manipulate him?",Penny,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" I know. I mean, do I open it? Do I return it?",Raj,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 So stipulated.,Sheldon,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Once I found a stash of contracts under his bed. It was weird.,Leonard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Penny’s apartment.,Scene,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 I wonder how much she spent on this.,Bernadette,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Ooh, let’s find out.",Amy,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 It doesn’t matter. It’s the thought that counts.,Raj,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Yeah, yeah, and beauty’s on the inside, size doesn’t matter, how much she spend?",Penny,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Seriously, guys, I don’t want to know.",Raj,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Oh, my.",Amy,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Oh, come on, you can’t say oh my, and then not tell me.",Raj,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 These things go for five hundred dollars and up.,Amy,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Damn. All I got for Valentine’s Day was a postcard saying my Vermont Teddy Bear was back-ordered.,Bernadette,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Okay, so, she drops off a five hundred dollar gift and she’s not trying to get back together with you?",Penny,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Maybe you’re right.,Raj,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" You know, I have too much self-esteem to let this girl guilt me into getting back together with her.",Raj,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 You don’t need to be pregnant to smell that load of crap.,Amy,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Okay, answer it. Just be strong. And if she starts to cry, don’t make any promises. And most importantly, put it on speaker so we can hear.",Penny,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Hello?,Raj,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Hey, it’s Emily. Is this a good time?",(voice),9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Yeah, yeah. Sure. What’s up?",Raj,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Was it okay I left that gift? I’m really hoping we can be friends.,Emily,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Maybe, maybe.",Raj,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Um, you think you’d want to grab a cup of coffee? Hello?",Emily,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" I’m sorry, I seem to be taking an annoying amount of time deciding how I feel about this.",Raj,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" I just, I miss hanging out with you. It’s not like I lost a friend, it’s like I lost my best friend. Is there any chance you’d want to come over?",Emily,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" I’m sorry, I don’t think that’s a good idea.",Raj,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Okay. I’m just, I’m having a really hard time, but that’s not your problem, that’s mine. I, I won’t bother you again, but please know that you’ll always have a place in my heart. Bye, Raj. You’re a good guy.",Emily,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Good-bye, Emily. That was rough, you guys.",Raj,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" I know, but you did it. I’m so proud of you.",Penny,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Well, anyway, I’ll leave you to your girls’ night.",Raj,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 But which one of us should be the party who…,Sheldon,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" You can do it, Sheldon.",Howard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Well, if you change your mind, we’ll be here.",Bernadette,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Thank you.,Raj,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Say hi to Emily for us.,Penny,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Will do.,Raj,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 The apartment.,Scene,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 This contract looks good to me.,Howard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" I’ll say it looks good. It’s in my proprietary font, Shelvetica.",Sheldon,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" I want to say something obnoxious, but it is easy on the eyes.",Leonard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" I’m a little tired, Howie. You ready to go?",Bernadette,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Yeah, one sec. I just need to sign this contract.",Howard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 What is it?,Bernadette,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Well, we ran into a problem about my share of the patent, so we’re forming a partnership to split anything we make equally.",Howard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Sheldon, did you draft the contract?",Penny,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 You bet I did.,Sheldon,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Or she’s telling the truth and just being nice.,Bernadette,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Maybe you’re right. Wow, I am easy to manipulate. (Phone rings) Oh, guys, it’s Emily. What should I do?",Raj,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Excuse me. I’ve been drafting contracts since kindergarten. Didn’t need a lawyer to get me out of finger painting. Don’t need one now.,Sheldon,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" I know, but…",Bernadette,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Bernie, the guys were nice enough to find a way to keep me from being cut out.",Howard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Well, I should hope so. The whole thing was your idea.",Bernadette,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Well, to be fair, Howard’s idea was based on Sheldon’s math.",Amy,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Guys, everyone is involved in thios, okay? Howard’s invention, Sheldon’s math, my original theory that space-time was like a supercooled liquid. Which I’m sure Penny would’ve mentioned if she wasn’t working on that hangnail right now.",Leonard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 What?,Penny,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Honey, this is fine.",Howard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" If you want to sign a contract that Sheldon whipped up, go ahead.",Bernadette,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Can I talk to you in the hall?,Howard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Sure.,Bernadette,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Excuse us.,Howard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Hey, Leonard.",Sheldon,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 What?,Leonard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Are you sure you don’t want to stay here with us?,Amy,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" No, I kind of feel like being alone right now.",Raj,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Okay, you got it. See, I was afraid it was a thinker.",Sheldon,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 What are you doing?,Howard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 I just want to make sure you’ve thought this through.,Bernadette,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 What’s to think about? We have an invention and want to move forward.,Howard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Howie, you’re about to form a legal partnership with Sheldon Cooper.",Bernadette,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" All right, if you’re gonna calmly make excellent points, then I don’t know if I want to talk to you. Okay. I get it. And it’s sweet that you’re worried about me, but I can take care of myself.",Howard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 I’m not worried about you. I’m worried about me. I don’t want to go through this pregnancy listening to you complain about Sheldon driving you crazy more than you already do.,Bernadette,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Here we go with the ironclad logic again.,Howard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 You’ve tried to work with him before. It hasn’t gone well. Why is this time gonna be any different?,Bernadette,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Is the foetus helping you? ‘Cause that’s cheating.,Howard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration

" Hey, Raj. It’s Claire. How are you?",Claire,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Hi. I’m good. Really good. Well, I don’t know why I said really good. I’m just regular good. I really just wanted to sound confident. And that really was a real really, not a fake really like the first really.",Raj,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Ooh. You’re gonna make out so hard tonight.,Penny,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" So, you’re just gonna sign this without having a lawyer look at it?",Bernadette,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Well, last time we talked, I had just gotten back together with my boyfriend, and I wanted to let you know that things didn’t work out.",Claire,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Really? I’m sorry. I swear I know other words.,Raj,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 So if you were still interested.,Claire,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Yes. Indeed. Absolutely. Indubitably. I’m not even sure what the last one means, but it’s another word, and I know it. So, uh, when do you want to meet up?",Raj,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Uh, I’m almost off work. What are you doing now?",Claire,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Right now, well, well, actually, to, to be completely honest, I’m stopping by to see my ex-girlfriend because she’s having a tough time. But it’s not like we’re getting back together or anything.",Raj,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Let me guess, the worst part about breaking up is that she doesn’t have her best friend to talk to any more?",Claire,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 That’s exactly what she said. How do you know that?,Raj,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" I’m a girl. It’s, like, page one out of the playbook.",Claire,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration

 They’ve been out there a while.,Leonard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 I hope everything’s okay.,Amy,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 I wonder what they’re talking about.,Sheldon,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" If she doesn’t think that we should apply for this patent, she’s being patently absurd.",Sheldon,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Good one.,Leonard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Hello.,Sheldon,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 You guys all right?,Leonard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Yeah. But, um, we were talking, and I’m a little concerned about the three of us forming a partnership.",Howard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Are you suggesting a limited liability corporation? ‘Cause I did not L-L-see that coming.,Sheldon,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Sheldon, my concern is not with the money or anything. It’s, it’s with how you treat me.",Howard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Well, I believe I’m treating you generously. That’s why I’ve stipulated in the contract that your contributions to our invention are as valuable as my own.",Sheldon,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Are you saying that his contributions aren’t as valuable as yours?,Bernadette,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" No, I am not saying that, because I kept saying that this morning and Leonard said stop saying that.",Sheldon,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 See? This is what happens every time we work together.,Howard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" You know what, hang on. What if Sheldon had no choice but to be respectful?",Penny,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 What? Is there a switch on the back of his neck we don’t know about?,Leonard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 No. What I’m saying is you could add a clause to the contract that he can’t make fun of Howard.,Penny,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 How would you enforce it?,Bernadette,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Oh, please. Any contract I sign is enforced by my own personal code of ethics.",Sheldon,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Really?,Claire,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" I don’t know. I lost track and I missed my exit. So, uh, so what’s up?",Raj,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Howard, what do you think?",Leonard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 I’m on board.,Howard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration

" Fine. Do what you want, but she’s playing you.",Claire,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 I don’t think so. She sounded pretty upset.,Raj,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" You mean like, I was just really looking forward to seeing you. I’m having such a rough day.",Claire,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" If you guys would shut up, I could tell you. Oh. Be cool, be cool, be cool.",Penny,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Hey.,Howard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 I’ve never applied for a patent before. I wanted to make a good impression.,Sheldon,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Is the impression that your first name is Pee-Wee?,Howard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Yeah, well, you’re an engineer. End of joke, burn.",Sheldon,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Come on in, fellas.",Attorney,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" See, he’s not wearing a tie.",Howard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Well, he’s a patent attorney. Maybe his tie is pending.",Leonard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" So, I’ve reviewed your paperwork, and it seems like we’ve got everything we need to file a patent for your infinite persistence gyroscope.",Attorney,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 That’s great.,Sheldon,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Excellent.,Howard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 So what happens next?,Leonard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Well, the legal team needs to review existing patents to avoid overlap.",Attorney,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Oh, I don’t think there will be.",Howard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Yeah, we did our own search.",Leonard,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" That’s nice, but I think ours might be a bit more thorough.",Attorney,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" Emily, listen, I’m sorry, but I can’t come by.",Raj,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 Why not?,Emily,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
" I think we both know if I come over, we’re gonna get back together and…",Raj,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration
 I told you I needed a friend. What do you think is happening here?,Emily,9.0,18.0,The Application Deterioration

 Can we really help?,Bernadette,9.0,19.0,The Solder Excursion Diversion
" While we finish soldering these boards, it’d be great if you guys could wrap these pipe fittings with Teflon tape.",Howard,9.0,19.0,The Solder Excursion Diversion
 I’ll show you how to do one.,Leonard,9.0,19.0,The Solder Excursion Diversion

 Good. Slow.,Leonard,9.0,19.0,The Solder Excursion Diversion

" Yeah, perfect.",Leonard,9.0,19.0,The Solder Excursion Diversion

" Well, we got to make a run to the hardware store.",Leonard,9.0,19.0,The Solder Excursion Diversion
 How can you call yourself a scientist and run out of solder?,Penny,9.0,19.0,The Solder Excursion Diversion

" Honey, honey, honey, let me stop you. That is, is not a funny story.",Penny,9.0,19.0,The Solder Excursion Diversion

 This meeting is a waste of time. Whether we make the switch from Post Raisin Bran to Kellogg’s Raisin Bran should not require parliamentary procedure.,Leonard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Well, you have to go. It’s Penny’s first time leading the Pledge of Allegiance.",Sheldon,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" You are, because dating two women, I mean, I can’t even remember the last time I slept in my own apartment. I wake up and I’m like, am I at Claire’s or am I at Emily’s? Is there a third girl I’ve forgotten about? Like, where am I?",Raj,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Hmm? Well, it sounds like the kind of thing one would bring up at a quarterly roommate agreement meeting. Lucky for you it’s tomorrow.",Sheldon,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Oh, Sheldon, we don’t need a meeting every three months.",Leonard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" I like a party as much as the next man, as long as the next man doesn’t like a party. Oh, by the way, don’t forget, tomorrow is our quarterly roommate agreement meeting.",Sheldon,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 Your attendance implies it’s not.,Leonard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Well, we’re only watching Game of Thrones. A party sub implies it’s a party.",Sheldon,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Man, I’m worn out.",Raj,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Scene,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" You keep talking like that, you’re gonna make colour guard.",Sheldon,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Because it’s important to him, and when we signed the roommate agreement, we made a deal.",Penny,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 Why are you taking his side?,Leonard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Well, I should hope so. Tomorrow’s picture day.",Sheldon,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Well, I will still come to your meeting.",Penny,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Because I am tired of him always getting his way. We don’t need a stupid meeting. We don’t even need a roommate agreement, and I hope that sandwich does cause a party.",Leonard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Well, why are you fighting him on this?",Penny,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 Can you please talk to him?,Leonard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 You know you’re gonna make up with him. Can we just skip to that part?,Penny,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 You’re being ridiculous.,Leonard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Of course, it will require a vote. Unfortunately, my official gavel is in my bedroom, but luckily, I have my travel gavel.",Sheldon,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 Thank you.,Leonard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Oh, fine. We don’t have to have a roommate agreement meeting if you don’t want to.",Sheldon,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 You have fun. I will not be attending.,Leonard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Mm, I think so. Dragons, snow zombies, and all the hot guys are dead.",Penny,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion

 The apartment.,Scene,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion

 You guys have fun. I’m just gonna snuggle up in bed with a book.,Bernadette,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 You sure you don’t want to come watch Game of Thrones with us?,Howard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 I feel you. I’ve been dating multiple women.,Raj,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 Good. A little tired.,Bernadette,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Hey, how’s the mommy-to-be?",Raj,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Hey, Raj.",Bernadette,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Totally, guys are the worst. I mean, look at me. I let Emily make me a frittata and I kept the leftovers in Claire’s fridge that night. I’m such a dog.",Raj,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 I guess I am lucky.,Howard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" But, dude, you’re so lucky. Getting to stay home at night with the woman you love.",Raj,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 You’re exhausted? Try folding every five pages in a pregnancy book so your wife thinks you read it.,Howard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" No, it’s just, ever since I started dating Claire and Emily at the same time, it’s exhausting.",Raj,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 I know. Imagine if we were actually moving.,Howard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 Stop saying meeting.,Leonard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Oh, it’s just a meeting. One simple meeting.",Sheldon,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 I don’t want to.,Leonard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 All this could be avoided if you’d just come to the meeting.,Sheldon,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 And I’d think you’d understand why I’m annoyed.,Leonard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" All right, you would think the only adult wouldn’t let something silly ruin our entire night.",Penny,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Tonight I’ll be watching a show rated M.A., and that stands for mature audiences, buster.",Sheldon,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Yeah, that’s right.",Leonard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 Really? The only adult?,Penny,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion

 Leave me alone.,Leonard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Uh-oh, somebody’s still pouting.",Penny,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Oh, I don’t know. Theon Greyjoy looks pretty good for a guy who had his genitals cut off.",Sheldon,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 What’s going on with him?,Amy,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 The apartment.,Scene,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Okay, that I said. But that’s a real problem. You give a girl another woman’s bra, and you will not be having sex with her that night. Maybe the other girl, but not her.",Raj,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 Don’t you hate it when you can’t remember whose bra it is you found wedged in your couch?,Howard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 I never said that.,Raj,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Oh, I wish could enjoy a cup of tea without a naked girl bouncing up and down on me.",Howard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 How could you say that?,Raj,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Actually, what you’re doing is pretending to complain, but really trying to brag.",Howard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" I’m sorry, have I been complaining about it too much?",Raj,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 There you go again.,Howard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" It’s not what I have, it’s how many people I’m having it with.",Raj,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" I’m not sure if I’m hoping for a boy or a girl. I mean, if it’s a boy, I’m gonna have to teach him to play catch. Which means I’m gonna have to google how to play catch. If it’s a girl, I mean, they’re so innocent and you know how guys are.",Howard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 Howard’s car.,Scene,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion

" Oh, Sheldon, I never thought re-filing a matter in a standing subcommittee could be so fascinating.",Amy,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 No. I don’t believe you. I could tell.,Sheldon,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 Sorry.,Amy,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 Wait. You were pretending?,Sheldon,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Well, I know how he feels. I never enjoyed our relationship agreement meetings.",Amy,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 I love Lisa Simpson.,Sheldon,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 She did.,Sheldon,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Well, then you don’t understand what’s happening. See, Leonard refused to participate in a mandatory quarterly roommate agreement meeting. This is what a generation raised on Bart Simpson looks like.",Sheldon,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Well, I get why he’s annoyed.",Amy,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Don’t worry, he’ll come around.",Penny,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Apparently, perfect attendance isn’t cool any more.",Sheldon,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Oh, he’s all bent out of shape about having a roommate agreement meeting.",Penny,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 Why do you get to pick?,Howard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Fine, I don’t want to watch with you either. I’ll go over here.",Raj,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 As long as I don’t have to watch with him.,Howard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 Do you guys want to watch with us?,Amy,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Leonard’s being a jerk, so we’re gonna watch over here.",Penny,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Wait, what is going on?",Howard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" It’s not always because they die. In one case, it’s because they’ve become involved with underground tree people from the dawn of time. Yeah, but I won’t say who it is. It’s Brann.",Sheldon,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Oh, good, go. You know, it’ll be nice to watch an episode without someone saying, I read the books, don’t get too fond of this character.",Leonard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 Gladly.,Sheldon,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Come on, Sheldon, we’ll watch Game of Thrones over here.",Penny,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 Yeah.,Howard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Oh, please. What could you possibly have that I would be jealous of?",Howard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Okay, I think I see what’s happening here. You’re jealous of me.",Raj,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 Just drop it.,Howard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Really? Because usually we walk side by side, and I just went up two flights of stairs staring at your bottom.",Raj,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" No, I’m fine.",Howard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 Stuart.,Leonard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion

" If Sheldon’s testosterone dipped, he’d become a butterfly. (Knock on door) Oh. Maybe someone’s here to apologize.",Leonard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 Interesting. Maybe my male cycle synced up with Raj’s actual period.,Howard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" You know, like women, men have a monthly hormone cycle. Dips in testosterone can cause irritability.",Amy,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Tell me about it. I’ve had it with Raj, too.",Howard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Oh, I just ran out of patience with Sheldon’s nonsense.",Leonard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 So what the hell happened?,Howard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 The apartment.,Scene,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion

 The apartment. ,Scene,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 I’m jealous. Closest I’ve come to dating two women was that time I dated one woman.,Stuart,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Says I was talking too much about dating Claire and Emily, and I accused him of being jealous.",Raj,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 So what happened with you and Howard?,Stuart,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Well, I’ll catch you up. Uh, Penny is angry at Leonard, Leonard’s angry at me and Penny, I’m angry at Leonard and Amy, Raj is angry at Howard, and I’m angry at George R.R. Martin ’cause there are no new books for me to spoil for Leonard.",Sheldon,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 Thanks. This thing kept getting caught in the chain of my bike.,Stuart,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion

 I don’t know. I like the pain of others.,Howard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 Son of a bitch. Why is that funny?,Leonard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 Okay. And did you know she has him add things to the roommate agreement so she can get her way and not fight with you about it?,Amy,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" I try to hide it in his peanut butter, but he spits it out.",Leonard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 Who’s the only one who can make him take his medicine when he’s sick?,Amy,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Penny, but…",Leonard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 Who’s always comforting him when he’s upset?,Amy,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
 I don’t think so. Why?,Leonard,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion
" Well, I just took your side ’cause sometimes I get annoyed at how close Sheldon and Penny are.",Amy,9.0,21.0,The Viewing Party Combustion

 I would love to. I do enjoy the complexity of an aged Pinot noir.,Raj,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 I’m sure that would pair nicely with your fried nuggets of chicken.,Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 That sounds fun.,Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 I bet you’d like a drink right now.,Howard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Well, little lady, you’ve heard of party hearty, get ready to party hardly.",Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 I guess we could give it a try.,Bernadette,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" The difference is she’s bringing life into the world, and you suck it out.",Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Sure, I guess. If you don’t think meeting your friends is too big a step.",Claire,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Hi, yeah. Um, I was wondering, if you’re free Saturday night, all my friends are going to a wine tasting.",Raj,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Hey, what’s up?",Claire,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Hey, Claire.",Raj,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Well, Bernadette, looks like Saturday night, it’s you and me.",Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Yeah, give her a break from, well, come on.",Penny,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Of course.,Bernadette,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 You sure?,Howard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" It’s okay, you should go.",Bernadette,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" No, it did at first, but then I talked it through with Frank and Alicia, and they really helped put things into perspective.",Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Does it bother you?,Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Of course.,Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" All right, here goes nothing.",Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 I am going to record this for posterity.,Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Okay. Everything’s hooked up. We’re ready.,Howard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" You, you and I spend a lot of time together. Can there be a little mystery between us?",Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Yes. And we’re going to prove that we don’t need alcohol to enjoy ourselves.,Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Hey, are you still hanging out with Bernadette tonight?",Penny,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Since my preschool got a bunny.,Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Are your sinuses acting up?,Penny,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" No, I’m still dating her.",Raj,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Does this mean Emily’s not in the picture anymore?,Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Funny how that worked out.,Raj,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Oh, but I won’t be there.",Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Oh, that’s great. I’ve been wanting her to meet you guys, too, so this seems like the perfect opportunity.",Raj,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Sure. I’d like to meet her.,Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Hey, you think it’d be okay if I brought Claire to the wine tasting?",Raj,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Howard’s workshop,Scene,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Okay, but you and I have been keeping things casual. Uh, will you introduce me as your friend or as your girlfriend? What if I like them and they don’t like me? What if they like me and I don’t like them?",Claire,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Nothing to worry about. People meet people all the time, and it isn’t weird. I met Bon Jovi once, which you’d think might be weird. Turns out, total sweetheart.",Raj,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 I don’t know. I just don’t want things to get weird.,Claire,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Why would it be too big a step?,Raj,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" You know, I don’t remember the last time it was just you and me hanging out.",Howard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Yeah. Cool.,Amy,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Oh. Cool.,Howard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Oh, we’re the first ones here.",Amy,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Hello.,phone),9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Raj’s apartment.,Scene,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Good, it’s not just me.",Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Actually, it’s making me dizzy.",Howard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" It’s, it’s beautiful.",Raj,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Eh, maybe it’s your voice. I’m gonna see if I can get James Earl Jones to do it in post.",Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Fine. Preliminary trial of the infinite persistence gyroscopic navigational system, phase one commencing.",Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Here goes nothing? This is the initial test of our prototype. Can we give it a little more gravitas?,Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Oh, no bubble baths either. They can increase the risk of a urinary tract infection.",Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" No honey baked ham in a hot tub, got it.",Penny,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Or caffeine, tobacco, sushi, soft cheese, processed meats and jacuzzis, which can all be harmful to an unborn baby.",Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Oh, good for you.",Penny,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Hey, Penny, isn’t that your old boyfriend Zack?",Amy,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Yeah, I know you’re teasing, but watch out for karma.",Raj,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Oh, so I shouldn’t ask her how she feels about being a member of your harem?",Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Oh, she’s meeting us here. Hey, guys, do me a favour and don’t ask too many questions about the relationship. We’re just keeping it casual.",Raj,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 I mostly just smell my nasal spray.,Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 You actually smell the wine?,Penny,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Oh, I found a scratch-and-sniff book about wine tasting. It teaches the different flavour notes to look for.",Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 What are you doing?,Penny,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Hang on.,Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Hey, you ready to go?",Penny,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 The apartment.,Scene,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Boy, it wasn’t this hard with Bon Jovi. I said you rock, he said, thanks, man, and that was that.",Raj,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 I know. What are they gonna talk about?,Howard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" So, Sheldon and Bernadette are hanging out.",Amy,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Oh, yeah, and we said we should do it more often. And, and, and, and, and here we are.",Howard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Oh, I do. It was three years ago.",Amy,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Yeah.,Bernadette,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Melba toast?,Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Yeah.,Bernadette,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Cinnamon toast?,Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Hey. Where is everybody?,Howard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 The wine tasting.,Scene,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Boy, do I love restrictions.",Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Okay, we’re leaving, love you, bye.",Penny,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Oh, and no contact with guinea pigs or hamsters or their droppings, uh, no-no cat litter boxes, no paint fumes.",Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 We’re leaving now!,Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Oh, and no swordfish, king mackerel, shark or tilefish, which are all high in mercury.",Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Okay, have fun.",Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Hey, while you decide, who was better in bed, big hot Zack or wheezy little Leonard? Neener neener.",Raj,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Uh, I don’t know.",Penny,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Are you gonna say hi to him?,Amy,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Oh, yeah.",Penny,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 We did.,Penny,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Hey, did you two get married?",Zack,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Hey.,Raj,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Hello.,Amy,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Where’s Claire?,Howard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 But yes.,Amy,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" No, two minutes.",Howard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 You guys been here long?,Penny,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Oh, thank God.",Amy,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Oh, good.",Howard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Hey.,Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 I don’t know. I really don’t know.,Amy,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 I’m getting an earthy note.,Amy,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 The wine tasting.,Scene,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Yeah.,Bernadette,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 You get where I’m going here?,Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" You could put it in a satellite or a rocket, and it’ll run forever.",Howard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Angular momentum. I was wondering about that.,Zack,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 What’s neat is that they can maintain angular momentum indefinitely.,Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Well, we’re using quantum vortices to replace gyroscopes in guidance systems.",Howard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Yeah.,Bernadette,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 You’ve heard of French toast?,Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 There’s more than one?,Bernadette,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Oh, I have quite the evening planned. Our foetus-friendly festival of fun begins with an in-depth look at the world of model trains, and then we’ll kick things up a notch and explore all the different ways that you can make toast.",Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 So what do you want to do tonight?,Bernadette,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Oh, the bubbles tickle my nose. I’ll just open this now so it can get nice and flat before we drink it.",Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 I brought sparkling cider.,Bernadette,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 The apartment.,Scene,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Cool. ‘Cause other than when you broke up with him and dated me, then broke up with me, and then dated me one more time before going back to him, I was always rooting for you two.",Zack,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Yes.,Penny,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 To each other?,Zack,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Yeah, mm-hmm.",Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 The wine tasting.,Scene,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Well, other than when they’re chugging through your bowels, these things are magic.",Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" That’s lovely, Sheldon.",Bernadette,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" What an interesting question. When I was a child, life was confusing and chaotic for me, and trains represented order. I could line them up, categorize them, control them. I guess you could say that they gave me a sense of calm in a world that didn’t.",Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Yeah, hey, buddy.",Howard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Oh. Zack, hi. You guys remember Zack.",Penny,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Penny?,Zack,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Just a whole lot of Afrin.,Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Really? Nothing?,Howard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 I smell nothing.,Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Also, uh, cherries?",Raj,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Ah, there’s definitely some oak.",Penny,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Is it better than the one they use now?,Zack,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 And I doubt the military would be interested in our little guidance system.,Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Yeah, but we didn’t create it for weapons.",Howard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Cool. Could it be used for missiles and war stuff?,Zack,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Dungeons & Dragons? That sounds about right.,Bernadette,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" And last but not least, this is one that I like to call Star Wars Toast because it has a light side and a dark side. All righty, it’s time for Dungeons & Dragons.",Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 The apartment. ,Scene,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 I said no questions.,Raj,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 So what’s your invention?,Zack,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Yeah, you know, the boxer who grew a moustache and became a scientist.",Howard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Mike deGrasse Tyson?,Amy,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Are you kidding? I love science. Einstein, Stephen Hawking, Mike deGrasse Tyson.",Zack,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 But we won’t bore you with the details.,Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 We’ve actually been working on a prototype for a navigation system we invented.,Howard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 So how’s the science world? What are you guys up to?,Zack,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Thanks.,Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Same reason I don’t talk about ass cancer. It’s not a pleasant topic.,Howard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Why didn’t you say something?,Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Me, too.",Howard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" I have to admit, I’ve been worried about the military applications since we started talking about this.",Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 The wine tasting.,Scene,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 He wants to see I.D.,Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" I storm in, slam my sword down, and say, barkeep, bring me the strongest ale you have and serve it in the skull of a goblin.",Bernadette,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 What do you do?,Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 What is it about trains that you like so much?,Bernadette,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" When I was five, I ingested a Z gauge locomotive. I spent the next three days saying, I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it.",Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" I’m sorry, I have to ask.",Bernadette,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" H-O gauge trains are 1/87th scale. N gauge are 1/160th scale. And that brings us to Z gauge, at a, you could easily swallow it, don’t ask how I know, 1 to 220.",Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 The apartment.,Scene,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Huh. You sure you guys are smart?,Zack,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Way better.,Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 A lot.,Howard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 All right.,Bernadette,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Oh, I have a feeling that once you start, you’re not gonna want to or be allowed to stop.",Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Okay, but just for a little bit.",Bernadette,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 You’re gonna enjoy this. I designed it especially for you.,Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" No, I mean re-evaluate what we’re doing with the guidance system.",Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Take a step back? I’m not a young man any more.,Howard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Maybe we should take a step back.,Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 The toilets.,Scene,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Would you like a glass of wine?,Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Hey, Claire. Good, you’re here. Guys, this is my friend Claire. We’re casually dating, and there’s no need for any further questions about it.",Raj,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Hey, Raj.",Claire,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Oh, Leonard mumbles it when he wants sex to last longer.",Penny,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 How do you know that?,Amy,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" E equals MC squared. Yeah. E is for energy, M for mass, and C for the speed of light.",Penny,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 It’s true. Even Einstein’s theory of relativity was later applied to the development of nuclear weapons.,Amy,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 You can’t let this stop you. Almost any scientific advancement can be used for destructive purposes.,Raj,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Boy, you get some dirty looks over there when you ask for ice.",Zack,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Uh, mostly Penny’s heard them.",Amy,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Really? Like what?,Claire,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" So, Claire, we’ve heard so many wonderful things about you.",Amy,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Good choice. Critical hit. Your sword goes through its eye into its tiny brain. With its final dying gasp, it says, you have reduced me to a pile of sushi. Enjoy me with this packet of soy sauce. It’s low sodium. Aaaah.",Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 I stab it in the middle eye.,Bernadette,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Three giant red ones and they never blink. It’s unsettling.,Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Does it have eyes?,Bernadette,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Oh, I haven’t had a drink in months.",Bernadette,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" You’re parched and weary from battle. You stand in front of a tavern that serves the coldest, most delicious ale in all the realm.",Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 This is getting fun. What’s next?,Bernadette,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" I think you’re gonna like a lot of things I have in store. For example, in this world, only the men get pregnant, so your husband is home trying not to pee when he laughs.",Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Oh. I like the idea of being tall.,Bernadette,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Your name is Bernatrix. You are a warrior queen. You’re strong, beautiful and tall.",Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 You bet.,Bernadette,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Ready?,Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 How?,Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Okay, let me stop you right there. We absolutely know our invention will not be used to destroy the world.",Howard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 What good is money gonna do if we inadvertently bring about Armageddon?,Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 But I got a baby on the way. I got to make some money.,Howard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Yeah, okay, just do me a favour and stop talking about how great Claire is.",Raj,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Oh, man, I didn’t mean to do that. But I do appreciate you recognizing my swimmer’s body. Which, incidentally, I got from playing Marco Polo at the YMCA.",Zack,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" I mean, come on, look at you. You’re classically handsome, you’ve got a swimmer’s body. Next to you, I look like me.",Raj,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 What are you talking about?,Zack,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Why are you being casual with her? She seems great.,Zack,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 I don’t know. Ask him.,Claire,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Why is he being casual with you? You seem great.,Zack,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 We’re just keeping it casual.,Raj,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Why’d you say she’s your friend?,Zack,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Uh, she’s seeing me.",Raj,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 You’re hot. You seeing anybody?,Zack,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Zack, this is my friend Claire.",Raj,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Oh, the fun doesn’t stop. You’re still going home with a goodie bag full of toast.",Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Wow, this night turned out to be so much more fun than I thought.",Bernadette,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Using your sword, you prepare a beautiful sushi dinner. You slip into the hot spring and enjoy the warm water on your aching joints. As you happily close your eyes, you recall the incredible evening you’ve had and notice that your feet and ankles are smaller than they’ve ever been. The end.",Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Okay, I guess I should eat the Hell Prawn.",Bernadette,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Morning.,Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 The apartment.,Scene,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Wow. Maybe none of you guys are smart.,Zack,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 You just did.,Amy,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 The Hell Prawn lunges out of the hot spring. You block it with your shield. Do you attack?,Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 The apartment.,Scene,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Not a lot. I just couldn’t start until you walked away.,Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Okay, then. Geez, how much wine did you drink?",Howard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Well, not really.",Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 You got something better?,Howard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Very funny.,Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Because no one from the future has come back to kill us.,Howard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Hey, did you ever think about the military applications for the guidance system?",Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Oh, I overdid it myself last night. Hair of the dog.",Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Ugh. Too much wine.,Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Morning.,Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 We didn’t.,Penny,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Why would you do that? I specifically asked you not to do that.,Raj,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Your friends were just telling me about all the other girls you’re dating.,Claire,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" So, uh, what are you guys talking about?",Raj,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Polo.,Zack,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Leonard, friends are like toilet paper. It’s good to have extras under the sink.",Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Who are these people?,Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Well, we’re out. Bernie can’t drink ’cause she’s pregnant. And she’s pregnant because we had sex. And we had sex because, well, come on.",Howard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 And now you know why I needed the massage.,Amy,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 The little choo-choo for toddlers?,Penny,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 And I shouldn’t have to see my boyfriend riding on a train for children around the mall.,Amy,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 I shouldn’t have to see my girlfriend get groped in public by another man.,Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 Mm-hmm.,Penny,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 How come scientists don’t win free stuff like salespeople do?,Leonard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
 ‘Cause we’re not in it for the stuff. We’re in it for the groupies.,Howard,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
" Personally, I find the notion of external rewards demeaning. I pursue science for the intrinsic joy of discovery.",Sheldon,9.0,22.0,The Fermentation Bifurcation
