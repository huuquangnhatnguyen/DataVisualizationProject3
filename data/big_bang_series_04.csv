" Ah, there you have it, gentlemen. Our entire dinner unpacked by robot.",Howard,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
 Whoo-hoo!,Raj,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
" Yes, exactly. Consequently, if Amy and I choose to bring new life into this world, it will be accomplished clinically, with fertility experts in a lab with petri dishes. Which reminds me, you have broad hips and a certain corn-fed vigour. Is your womb available for rental?",Sheldon,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
 Huh. It would appear as if the phone companies have been lying to me.,Sheldon,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
 Probably not.,Penny,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation

" Okay, look, don’t think of it as dating a girlfriend. Think of it as, uh, getting to know the future mother of your child.",Penny,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
 She’s not my girlfriend.,Sheldon,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
 Why not?,Penny,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
 I can’t date Amy.,Sheldon,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation

" Then, this is my first date.",Sheldon,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
 No.,Penny,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
 That depends. Does square-dancing with my sister at a Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown count as a date?,Sheldon,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
" Yeah. Well, my question is, and I’m pretty sure I know the answer, is this your first date?",Penny,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation

 No.,Amy,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
" Any follow up, Amy?",Penny,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
 All right. It was hell.,Sheldon,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
" Well, why don’t you tell her?",Penny,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
 No.,Sheldon,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation

" You do what you want, I’m not touching another man’s honey tree.",Leonard,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
" A-All right, um, how about this. When, when Winnie the Pooh got his head stuck in the honey tree, his friends all grabbed onto him and pulled and pulled.",Raj,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
" No, no! I loaded the wrong program. The hand thinks it’s holding a screwdriver in outer space. If you continue the program, it’s gonna start twisting.",Howard,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation

" Not funny, Leonard.",Howard,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
" I’d suggest a lubricant, but I have a feeling you fell on some of that as well.",Leonard,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
" Yes. Now, help me!",Howard,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
 Penis first?,Raj,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation

 Although that number would be fairly easy to calculate.,Sheldon,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
 No.,Penny,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
 Remarkable. Did you have sexual intercourse with all of these men?,Amy,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation

 14.,Penny,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
 I’m sorry. 16?,Sheldon,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
" Whoa, wait, wait, wait. I did not start dating at 15.",Penny,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
" Simple extrapolation. In the three years that I’ve known you, you were single for two. During that time, I saw 17 different suitors. If we work backwards, correcting for observation bias and postulate an initial dating age of 15…",Sheldon,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
 What? Where did you get 171 men?,Penny,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
 Your characterization of approximately 171 different men as a few.,Sheldon,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
" Uh, yeah, I wouldn’t say many. A few. (Sheldon laugh’s strangely). What’s (imitates Sheldon’s laugh)",Penny,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
" Once a year. It’s a deal I made with my mother in exchange for her silence on the matter, as well as the occasional use of her George Foreman Grill that seals in the flavour without the fat. How about you, Penny? Do you go on many dates?",Amy,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
" So, um, Amy, what about you? Do you date much?",Penny,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
" Apparently, a semi-incestuous Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown didn’t count.",Sheldon,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
 Is this true?,Amy,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
" No, no. My point is, uh, tonight is Sheldon’s first official date. Discuss.",Penny,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
" Excuse me, could you help us out?",Leonard,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
" Next time, take your own advice.",Raj,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation

" No! No! No. Let’s just all finish our dinners, okay?",Penny,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
" This is very interesting. Cultural perceptions are subjective. Penny, to your mind, are you a slut?",Amy,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
" Okay, Sheldon, you are so wrong. That is not even close to the real number. I’m gonna need a drink over here.",Penny,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
" So we multiply 193, minus 21 men before the loss of virginity, so 172 times 0.18 gives us 30.96 sexual partners. Let’s round that up to 31.",Sheldon,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
" Okay, Sheldon, I think you’ve made your point.",Penny,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
" Based on the number of awkward encounters I’ve had with strange men leaving her apartment in the morning, plus the number of times she’s returned home wearing the same clothes she wore the night before…",Sheldon,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
 Oh.,Penny,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
 Now can we have cookies and Hawaiian Punch?,Raj,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
" No, you see, it’s more complicated than that. (Nurse switches off computer) No, wait! (The hand lets go) Winnie the Pooh is out of the honey tree.",Howard,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation

 But it’s frozen.,Howard,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
" Uh, it’s what controls the arm.",Leonard,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
" I’m sorry, we don’t have a code for robot hand grasping a man’s penis. Why is it hooked up to a computer?",Nurse,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation
 You think you could be a little more discreet?,Howard,4.0,1.0,The Robotic Manipulation

 Sorry we’re late.,Sheldon,4.0,3.0,The Zazzy Substitution

" Ah, ah.",Howard,4.0,3.0,The Zazzy Substitution
 Okay.,Leonard,4.0,3.0,The Zazzy Substitution

" No, no, of course not. Just have your relationship someplace else.",Leonard,4.0,3.0,The Zazzy Substitution
" May I point out that for eight long months, I suffered in silence as your female companion filled our apartment with her off-key country music caterwauling, the unappetizing spectacle of her grinding a pumice stone against her calloused feet in our living room, and night after night of uninformative TV documentaries about the Jersey Shore.",Sheldon,4.0,3.0,The Zazzy Substitution
 Oh. I don’t like that. Don’t do that.,Amy,4.0,3.0,The Zazzy Substitution
 All righty. What’s new?,Penny,4.0,3.0,The Zazzy Substitution
" Well, just recently, I learned that you refer to us as Shamy, and I don’t like that.",Amy,4.0,3.0,The Zazzy Substitution

 You take that back.,Sheldon,4.0,3.0,The Zazzy Substitution
" Absolutely not. My colleagues and I are mapping the neurological substrates that subserve global information processing, which is required for all cognitive reasoning, including scientific inquiry, making my research ipso facto prior in the ordo cognoscendi. That means it’s better than his research, and by extension, of course, yours.",Amy,4.0,3.0,The Zazzy Substitution
" I’m sorry, I’m-I’m still trying to work on the defecating Clark Maxwell, so…",Leonard,4.0,3.0,The Zazzy Substitution

" Oh, yeah? What’s that look like?",Raj,4.0,7.0,The Apology Insufficiency

" Right. Now, how would you characterize your relationship with Mr. Wolowitz?",Page,4.0,7.0,The Apology Insufficiency
" Yes. Of course, we’re in different departments. He’s an engineer and I’m an experimental physicist. You know, one of those guys who examines the building blocks of creation and says, Hello, maker of the universe, I see what you did there. Good one.",Leonard,4.0,7.0,The Apology Insufficiency

" Howard, if I may interject here with a piece of friendly advice. Is working on magic tricks really how you want to spend your time? Granted, you’re just an engineer, but that doesn’t mean you might not someday build a geegaw or a thingamabob that may get you a thank you in someone else’s Nobel prize acceptance speech.",Sheldon,4.0,18.0,The Prestidigitation Approximation

" That’s your card, right?",Howard,4.0,18.0,The Prestidigitation Approximation
 Seven of clubs! That is amazing!,Penny,4.0,18.0,The Prestidigitation Approximation
 It’s not amazing. All magic tricks are merely a combination of manipulation and misdirection with the occasional dwarf in a box wiggling his feet.,Sheldon,4.0,18.0,The Prestidigitation Approximation
" Oh, really? So how did I do it?",Howard,4.0,18.0,The Prestidigitation Approximation
