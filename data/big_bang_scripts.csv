Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,A corridor at a sperm bank.,Sheldon,"So if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it and either slit is observed it will not go through both slits. If it’s unobserved it will, however, if it’s observed after it’s left the plane but before it hits its target, it will not have gone through both slits."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,A corridor at a sperm bank.,Leonard,"Agreed, what’s your point?"
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,A corridor at a sperm bank.,Sheldon,"There’s no point, I just think it’s a good idea for a tee-shirt."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,A corridor at a sperm bank.,Leonard,Excuse me?
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,A corridor at a sperm bank.,Receptionist,Hang on.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,A corridor at a sperm bank.,Leonard,"One across is Aegean, eight down is Nabakov, twenty-six across is MCM, fourteen down is… move your finger… phylum, which makes fourteen across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc’s capital idea, that’s Port-au-Prince. Haiti."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,A corridor at a sperm bank.,Receptionist,Can I help you?
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,A corridor at a sperm bank.,Leonard,"Yes. Um, is this the High IQ sperm bank?"
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,A corridor at a sperm bank.,Receptionist,"If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn’t be here."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,A corridor at a sperm bank.,Sheldon,I think this is the place.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,A corridor at a sperm bank.,Receptionist,Fill these out.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,A corridor at a sperm bank.,Leonard,Thank-you. We’ll be right back.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,A corridor at a sperm bank.,Receptionist,"Oh, take your time. I’ll just finish my crossword puzzle. Oh wait."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,A corridor at a sperm bank.,,(They sit and begin to fill in forms).
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,A corridor at a sperm bank.,Sheldon,"Leonard, I don’t think I can do this."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,A corridor at a sperm bank.,Leonard,"What, are you kidding? You’re a semi-pro."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,A corridor at a sperm bank.,Sheldon,"No. We are committing genetic fraud. There’s no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high IQ offspring, think about that. I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,A corridor at a sperm bank.,Leonard,"Sheldon, this was your idea. A little extra money to get fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,A corridor at a sperm bank.,Sheldon,"I know, and I do yearn for faster downloads, but there’s some poor woman is going to pin her hopes on my sperm, what if she winds up with a toddler who doesn’t know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,A corridor at a sperm bank.,Leonard,I’m sure she’ll still love him.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,A corridor at a sperm bank.,Sheldon,I wouldn’t.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,A corridor at a sperm bank.,Leonard,"Well, what do you want to do?"
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,A corridor at a sperm bank.,Sheldon,I want to leave.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,A corridor at a sperm bank.,Leonard,Okay.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,A corridor at a sperm bank.,Sheldon,What’s the protocol for leaving?
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,A corridor at a sperm bank.,Leonard,"I don’t know, I’ve never reneged on a proffer of sperm before."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,A corridor at a sperm bank.,Sheldon,Let’s try just walking out.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,A corridor at a sperm bank.,Leonard,Okay.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,A corridor at a sperm bank.,Receptionist,Bye.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,A corridor at a sperm bank.,Sheldon,Bye-bye
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,A corridor at a sperm bank.,Leonard,See you.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Sheldon,Are you still mad about the sperm bank?
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Leonard,No.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Sheldon,You want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Leonard,Not really.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Sheldon,"If the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimetres, most people will trip."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Leonard,I don’t care. Two millimetres? That doesn’t seem right.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Sheldon,"No, it’s true, I did a series of experiments when I was twelve, my father broke his clavicle."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Leonard,Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Sheldon,"No, that was the result of my work with lasers."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Leonard,New neighbour?
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Sheldon,Evidently.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Leonard,Significant improvement over the old neighbour.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Sheldon,"Two hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes she is."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Penny,"Oh, hi!"

Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Leonard,"We don’t mean to interrupt, we live across the hall."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Penny,"Oh, that’s nice."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Leonard,"Oh… uh… no… we don’t live together… um… we live together but in separate, heterosexual bedrooms."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Penny,"Oh, okay, well, guess I’m your new neighbour, Penny."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Leonard,"Leonard, Sheldon."

Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Penny,Great.

Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Penny,Bye.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Sheldon,Bye.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Leonard,Bye.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Leonard,Should we have invited her for lunch?
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Sheldon,No. We’re going to start Season Two of Battlestar Galactica.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Leonard,We already watched the Season Two DVDs.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Sheldon,Not with commentary.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Leonard,"I think we should be good neighbours, invite her over, make her feel welcome."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Sheldon,We never invited Louis-slash-Louise over.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Leonard,"Well, then that was wrong of us. We need to widen our circle."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Sheldon,I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Leonard,"Yes, and you’ve never met one of them."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Sheldon,That’s the beauty of it.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Leonard,I’m going to invite her over. We’ll have a nice meal and chat.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Sheldon,Chat? We don’t chat. At least not offline.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Leonard,"Well it’s not difficult, you just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Sheldon,To what end?
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Leonard,Hi. Again.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Penny,Hi.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Sheldon,Hi.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Leonard,Hi.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Penny,Hi.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Leonard,"Anyway, um. We brought home Indian food. And, um. I know that moving can be stressful, and I find that when I’m undergoing stress, that good food and company can have a comforting effect. Also, curry is a natural laxative, and I don’t have to tell you that, uh, a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Sheldon,"Leonard, I’m not expert here but I believe in the context of a luncheon invitation, you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Penny,"Oh, you’re inviting me over to eat?"
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Leonard,"Uh, yes."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Penny,"Oh, that’s so nice, I’d love to."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Leonard,Great.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Penny,"So, what do you guys do for fun around here?"
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,Sheldon,"Well, today we tried masturbating for money."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,The stairs of the apartment building.,,Credits sequence.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,"Okay, well, make yourself at home."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Penny,"Okay, thankyou."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,You’re very welcome.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Penny,"This looks like some serious stuff, Leonard, did you do this?"
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,Actually that’s my work.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Penny,Wow.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Yeah, well, it’s just some quantum mechanics, with a little string theory doodling around the edges. That part there, that’s just a joke, it’s a spoof of the Bourne-Oppenheimer approximation."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Penny,"So you’re like, one of those, beautiful mind genius guys."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,Yeah.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Penny,This is really impressive.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,"I have a board. If you like boards, this is my board."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Penny,Holy smokes.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,"If by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men’s room at MIT, sure."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,What?
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, come on. Who hasn’t seen this differential below “here I sit broken hearted?”"
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,At least I didn’t have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,"I didn’t invent them, they’re there."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,In what universe?
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,"In all of them, that is the point."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Penny,"Uh, do you guys mind if I start?"
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Um, Penny, that’s where I sit."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Penny,"So, sit next to me."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,"No, I sit there."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Penny,What’s the difference?
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,What’s the difference?
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,Here we go.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,"In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer it’s directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion, I could go on, but I think I’ve made my point."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Penny,Do you want me to move?
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,Well.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,Just sit somewhere else.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Fine.(Wanders in circles, looking lost.)"
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,"Sheldon, sit!"
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,Aaah!
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,Well this is nice. We don’t have a lot of company over.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,That’s not true. Koothrapali and Wolowitz come over all the time.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,"Yes I now, but…"
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,Tuesday night we played Klingon boggle until one in the morning.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,"Yes, I remember."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,I resent you saying we don’t have company.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,I’m sorry.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,That is an antisocial implication.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,I said I’m sorry.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Penny,"So, Klingon boggle?"
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,"Yeah, it’s like regular boggle but, in Klingon. That’s probably enough about us, tell us about you."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Penny,"Um, me, okay, I’m Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need to know."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Penny,Participate in the what?
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,"I think what Sheldon’s trying to say, is that Sagittarius wouldn’t have been our first guess."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Penny,"Oh, yeah, a lot of people think I’m a water sign. Okay, let’s see, what else, oh, I’m a vegetarian, oh, except for fish, and the occasional steak, I love steak."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,That’s interesting. Leonard can’t process corn.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,"Wu-uh, do you have some sort of a job?"
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Penny,"Oh, yeah, I’m a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, okay. I love cheesecake."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,You’re lactose intolerant.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,"I don’t eat it, I just think it’s a good idea."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Penny,"Oh, anyways, I’m also writing a screenplay. It’s about this sensitive girl who comes to L.A. from Lincoln Nebraska to be an actress, and winds up a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,So it’s based on your life?
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Penny,"No, I’m from Omaha."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,"Well, if that was a movie I would go see it."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Penny,"I know, right? Okay, let’s see, what else? Um, that’s about it. That’s the story of Penny."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,Well it sounds wonderful.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Penny,It was. Until I fell in love with a jerk.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon(mouths),What’s happening.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard(mouths back),I don’t know.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Penny,"Oh God, you know, four years I lived with him, four years, that’s like as long as High School."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,It took you four years to get through High School?
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,Don’t.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Penny,"I just, I can’t believe I trusted him."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,"You? No, you’ll only make it worse."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Penny,"You want to know the most pathetic part? Even though I hate his lying, cheating guts, I still love him. Is that crazy?"
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,Yes.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,"No, it’s not crazy it’s, uh, uh, it’s a paradox. And paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. Now if you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. Well, I didn’t make it worse."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Penny,"Oh, I’m so sorry, I’m such a mess, and on top of everything else I’m all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn’t even work."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,Our shower works.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Penny,Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it?
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,Yes.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,No.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,No?
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,No.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,No.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,It’s right down the hall.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Penny,Thanks. You guys are really sweet.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,Well this is an interesting development.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,How so?
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,"That’s not true, remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with Alzheimer’s had that episode."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,Point taken. It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn’t want to rip our eyes out.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,"So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?"
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,Excuse me?
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,That woman in there’s not going to have sex with you.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,Well I’m not trying to have sex with her.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, good. Then you won’t be disappointed."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,"What makes you think she wouldn’t have sex with me, I’m a male and she’s a female?"
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Yes, but not of the same species."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,"I’m not going to engage in hypotheticals here, I’m just trying to be a good neighbour."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, of course."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,That’s not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that I wouldn’t participate. However briefly.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,It’s Darth Vader shampoo.(There is a knock on the door.)Luke Skywalker’s the conditioner.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Howard,Wait till you see this.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Raj,It’s fantastic. Unbelievable.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,See what?
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Howard,It’s a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,This is not a good time.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Howard,It’s before he became a creepy computer voice:.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,"That’s great, you guys have to go."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Raj,Why?
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,It’s just not a good time.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,Leonard has a lady over.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Howard,"Yeah, right, your grandmother back in town?"
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,"No. And she’s not a lady, she’s just a new neighbour."
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Howard,"Hang on, there really is a lady here?"
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,Uh-huh.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Howard,And you want us out because you’re anticipating coitus?
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,I’m not anticipating coitus.
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Howard,So she’s available for coitus?
Series 01,Episode 01,Pilot Episode,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Leonard,Can we please stop saying coitus?

Series 01,Episode 03,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,The same.,Leonard,Yeah. He was kinda dreamy.
Series 01,Episode 03,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,The same.,Sheldon,"Well, at least now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted smouldering wreckage that was once your fantasy of dating her, and analyse the data so that you don’t crash into geek mountain again."

Series 01,Episode 03,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,The same.,Sheldon,"Well, I don’t think you have a shot there. I have noticed that Lesley Winkle recently started shaving her legs. Now, given that winter is coming one can only assume that she is signalling sexual availability."

Series 01,Episode 03,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Howard and Lesley’s lab.,Leonard,Hello Lesley.
Series 01,Episode 03,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Howard and Lesley’s lab.,Lesley,Hi Leonard.
Series 01,Episode 03,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Howard and Lesley’s lab.,Leonard,Lesley I would like to propose an experiment.
Series 01,Episode 03,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Howard and Lesley’s lab.,Lesley,"Goggles, Leonard."
Series 01,Episode 03,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Howard and Lesley’s lab.,Leonard,"Right. Lesley, I would like to propose an experiment."
Series 01,Episode 03,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Howard and Lesley’s lab.,Lesley,Hang on. I’m trying to see how long it takes a five hundred kilowatt oxygen iodine laser to heat up my cup o’ noodles.
Series 01,Episode 03,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Howard and Lesley’s lab.,Leonard,"Pfff, I’ve done it, about two seconds, 2.6 for minestrone. Anyway, I was thinking more of a bio-social exploration with a neuro-chemical overlay."
Series 01,Episode 03,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Howard and Lesley’s lab.,Lesley,"Wait, are you asking me out?"
Series 01,Episode 03,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Howard and Lesley’s lab.,Leonard,"I was going to characterise it as the modification of our colleague/friendship paradigm, with the addition of a date-like component. But we don’t need to quibble over terminology."
Series 01,Episode 03,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Howard and Lesley’s lab.,Lesley,What sort of experiment would you propose?
Series 01,Episode 03,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Howard and Lesley’s lab.,Leonard,"There is a generally accepted pattern in this area, I would pick you up, take you to a restaurant, then we would see a movie, probably a romantic comedy featuring the talents of Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock."
Series 01,Episode 03,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Howard and Lesley’s lab.,Lesley,Interesting. And would you agree that the primary way we would evaluate either the success or failure of the date would be based on the bio-chemical reaction during the goodnight kiss.
Series 01,Episode 03,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Howard and Lesley’s lab.,Leonard,"Heartrate, pheromones, etc, yes."
Series 01,Episode 03,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Howard and Lesley’s lab.,Lesley,"Well, why don’t we just stipulate that the date goes well and move to the key variable."
Series 01,Episode 03,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Howard and Lesley’s lab.,Leonard,"You mean, kiss you now?"
Series 01,Episode 03,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Howard and Lesley’s lab.,Lesley,Yes.
Series 01,Episode 03,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Howard and Lesley’s lab.,Leonard,Can you define the parameters of the kiss?
Series 01,Episode 03,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Howard and Lesley’s lab.,Lesley,Closed mouth but romantic. Mint?
Series 01,Episode 03,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Howard and Lesley’s lab.,Leonard,Thank you.(Takes mint). Shall I count down from three?
Series 01,Episode 03,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Howard and Lesley’s lab.,Lesley,"No, I think it needs to be spontaneous."
Series 01,Episode 03,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Howard and Lesley’s lab.,,(They kiss.)
Series 01,Episode 03,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Howard and Lesley’s lab.,Lesley,What do you think.
Series 01,Episode 03,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Howard and Lesley’s lab.,Leonard,"You proposed the experiment, I think you should present your findings first."
Series 01,Episode 03,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Howard and Lesley’s lab.,Lesley,"Fair enough. On the plus side, it was a good kiss, reasonable technique, no extraneous spittle. On the other hand, no arousal."
Series 01,Episode 03,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Howard and Lesley’s lab.,Leonard,None?
Series 01,Episode 03,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Howard and Lesley’s lab.,Lesley,None.

Series 01,Episode 03,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,"Sheldon and Leonard’s flat. Sheldon, Raj and Howard are playing Jenga.",Howard,"Maybe, although the history of science-fiction is not on your side."
Series 01,Episode 03,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,"Sheldon and Leonard’s flat. Sheldon, Raj and Howard are playing Jenga.",Sheldon,"Uh, let me ask you this. When I learn that I’m a robot, would I be bound by Asimov’s three laws of robotics?"

Series 01,Episode 04,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Put it on the back burner. Anyway, it occurs to me, if I ever did perfect a time machine, I’d just go into the past and give it to myself, thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place."

How fortunate for you that the University has chosen to hire you, despite the fact that you’ve done no original research in 25 years, and instead have written a series of popular books that reduce the great concepts of science to a series of anecdotes, each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration of an average bowel movement.

Series 01,Episode 04,The Luminous Fish Effect,Penny’s car,Sheldon,"No it doesn’t. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays, or there are motion sensors involved."
Series 01,Episode 04,The Luminous Fish Effect,Penny’s car,Penny,"No, no, I meant…"

Series 01,Episode 04,The Luminous Fish Effect,Penny’s car,Sheldon,"Fine. We’re travelling forward at, good Lord, 51 miles an hour. Now let’s assume that your brakes are new and the callipers are aligned, still, by the time we come to a stop, we’ll be occupying the same space as that Buick in front of us, an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death, mutilation and… oh look, they built a new put-put course."

Series 01,Episode 04,The Luminous Fish Effect,The supermarket.,Sheldon,"Uh, yes, but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket."
Series 01,Episode 04,The Luminous Fish Effect,The supermarket.,Penny,"Oh, okay, well maybe you should start heading on out then."
Series 01,Episode 04,The Luminous Fish Effect,The supermarket.,Sheldon,"No, this is fun. Oh, the thing about tomatoes, and I think you’ll really enjoy this, is, they’re shelved with the vegetables, but they’re technically a fruit."
Series 01,Episode 04,The Luminous Fish Effect,The supermarket.,Penny,Interesting.
Series 01,Episode 04,The Luminous Fish Effect,The supermarket.,Sheldon,Isn’t it?
Series 01,Episode 04,The Luminous Fish Effect,The supermarket.,Penny,"No, I mean what you find enjoyable."

Series 01,Episode 04,The Luminous Fish Effect,The supermarket.,Penny,What now?
Series 01,Episode 04,The Luminous Fish Effect,The supermarket.,Sheldon,"Well, there’s some value to taking a multivitamin, but the human body can only absorb so much, what you’re buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine."
Series 01,Episode 04,The Luminous Fish Effect,The supermarket.,Penny,"Well, maybe that’s what I was going for."

Series 01,Episode 04,The Luminous Fish Effect,On the stairwell of the apartment building.,Sheldon,"Are you sure. There are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk. For example, I noticed that you purchase your tampons one month’s supply at a time."
Series 01,Episode 04,The Luminous Fish Effect,On the stairwell of the apartment building.,Penny,What?
Series 01,Episode 04,The Luminous Fish Effect,On the stairwell of the apartment building.,Sheldon,"Well think about it, it’s a product that doesn’t spoil, and you’re going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years."
Series 01,Episode 04,The Luminous Fish Effect,On the stairwell of the apartment building.,Penny,You want me to buy thirty years worth of tampons?
Series 01,Episode 04,The Luminous Fish Effect,On the stairwell of the apartment building.,Sheldon,"Well, thirty, thirty five, hey, when did your mother go into menopause?"
Series 01,Episode 04,The Luminous Fish Effect,On the stairwell of the apartment building.,Penny,"Okay, I’m not talking about this with you."
Series 01,Episode 04,The Luminous Fish Effect,On the stairwell of the apartment building.,Sheldon,"Oh, Penny, this is a natural human process, and we’re talking about statistically significant savings. Now, if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28 day cycle, are you fairly regular?(Penny shuts door in his face.)Okay, no warehouse store, but we’re still on for put-put golf, right?"
Series 01,Episode 04,The Luminous Fish Effect,"The apartment, Sheldon has several bowls containing goldfish.",Leonard (entering),"Hey, I just ran into Penny, she seemed upset about something."

Series 01,Episode 04,The Luminous Fish Effect,"The apartment, Sheldon has several bowls containing goldfish.",Leonard,So… fish.
Series 01,Episode 04,The Luminous Fish Effect,"The apartment, Sheldon has several bowls containing goldfish.",Sheldon,"I read an article about Japanese scientists, who inserted DNA from luminous jellyfish into other animals, and I thought hey, fish nightlights."

Series 01,Episode 04,The Luminous Fish Effect,"The apartment, Sheldon has several bowls containing goldfish.",Sheldon,"Oh, no, no, no. No, I’ve too much to do."
Series 01,Episode 04,The Luminous Fish Effect,"The apartment, Sheldon has several bowls containing goldfish.",Leonard,Like luminous fish.
Series 01,Episode 04,The Luminous Fish Effect,"The apartment, Sheldon has several bowls containing goldfish.",Sheldon,Shhhhh!

Series 01,Episode 04,The Luminous Fish Effect,The stairwell of the apartment building.,Sheldon,"I know, but why?"
Series 01,Episode 04,The Luminous Fish Effect,The stairwell of the apartment building.,Leonard,Because one of the great minds of the twenty-first century is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving sarapes.
Series 01,Episode 04,The Luminous Fish Effect,The stairwell of the apartment building.,Sheldon,"This is not a sarape. This is a poncho. A sarape is open at the sides, a poncho is closed, this is a poncho, and neither is a reason to call someone’s mother."

Series 01,Episode 05,The Hamburger Postulate,The stairwell of the apartment building.,Sheldon,"Well I assume she meant that the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute. An alternate, and somewhat less likely interpretation, is that you could manufacture one. As in, oh look, Leonard and Lesley made Mr and Mrs Goldfarb, aren’t they adorable."
Series 01,Episode 05,The Hamburger Postulate,The stairwell of the apartment building.,Leonard,"If Penny didn’t know that Lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought that I should her, Lesley, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her, Penny, out. But because she did know that I had asked Lesley out and that she, Lesley, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering consolation. That’s too bad, you would have made a cute couple. But while thinking, good, Leonard remains available."

Series 01,Episode 05,The Hamburger Postulate,The hallway.,Leonard,"Thank you. What did she mean, she’s happy for me? Is she happy because I’m seeing someone, or is she happy because she thinks that I’m happy, because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy, even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy. You know, because the second person, though happy, is now romantically unavailable to the first person."
Series 01,Episode 05,The Hamburger Postulate,The hallway.,Sheldon,Do you realise I may have to share a Nobel Prize with your booty call?

Series 01,Episode 05,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard and Lesley’s lab.,Leonard,"I’m not sure, but I think I’m about to discover how the banana felt."
Series 01,Episode 05,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard and Lesley’s lab.,Lesley,"Listen, Leonard, neither of us are neuroscientists but we both understand the biochemistry of sex, I mean, dopamine in our brains is released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat’s brain, give him an orgasm button, he’ll push that thing until he starves to death."
Series 01,Episode 05,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard and Lesley’s lab.,Leonard,Who wouldn’t?
Series 01,Episode 05,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard and Lesley’s lab.,Lesley,"Well, the only difference between us and a rat is that you can’t stick an electrode in our hypothalamus. That’s where you come in."

Series 01,Episode 05,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard and Lesley’s lab.,Leonard(leaving),Sorry.
Series 01,Episode 05,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard and Lesley’s lab.,Howard,"Hey, look, it’s Doctor Stud!"
Series 01,Episode 05,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard and Lesley’s lab.,Leonard,Doctor what?
Series 01,Episode 05,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard and Lesley’s lab.,Howard,The blogosphere is a-buzzing with news of you and Lesley Winkle making eine kleine bang-bang music.

Series 01,Episode 05,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard and Lesley’s lab.,Leonard,"Well, how did you know about it?"

Series 01,Episode 05,The Hamburger Postulate,The Cheesecake Factory.,Sheldon,"Way ahead of you. I was thinking of moving Big Boy to Thursdays, and just dropping Soup Plantation."
Series 01,Episode 05,The Hamburger Postulate,The Cheesecake Factory.,Leonard,Really?
Series 01,Episode 05,The Hamburger Postulate,The Cheesecake Factory.,Sheldon,"Yeah, the name always confused me anyway, Soup Plantation. You can’t grow soup."

Series 01,Episode 05,The Hamburger Postulate,The Cheesecake Factory.,Leonard,Well what did she mean by that? Was that just a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention?
Series 01,Episode 05,The Hamburger Postulate,The Cheesecake Factory.,Sheldon,You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy? This is a single decker hamburger whereas the Big Boy is a double decker. This has a much more satisfying meat to bun to condiment ratio.
Series 01,Episode 05,The Hamburger Postulate,The Cheesecake Factory.,Leonard,Are you even listening to me?
Series 01,Episode 05,The Hamburger Postulate,The Cheesecake Factory.,Sheldon,"Of course I’m listening. Blah blah, hopeless Penny delusion, blah blah blah."

Series 01,Episode 08,The Grasshopper Experiment,The restaurant.,Penny,I know the reason.
Series 01,Episode 08,The Grasshopper Experiment,The restaurant.,Leonard,"We all know the reason. Sheldon, what are you getting at?"
Series 01,Episode 08,The Grasshopper Experiment,The restaurant.,Sheldon,That woman looks exactly like the pictures of Princess Punchali in the book. How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life?
Series 01,Episode 08,The Grasshopper Experiment,The restaurant.,Howard,"Every year at Comic Con. Every day at Disneyland you can hire Snow White to come to your house. Course they prefer it if you have a kid, but…"
Series 01,Episode 08,The Grasshopper Experiment,The restaurant.,Raj,"Hey guys. This is Lalita Gupta, Lalita this is Leonard and Sheldon and Howard and Penny. Isn’t it great, she isn’t fat any more!"
Series 01,Episode 08,The Grasshopper Experiment,The restaurant.,Sheldon,"Forgive me your highness, for I am but a monkey, and it is in my nature to climb. I did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair."
Series 01,Episode 08,The Grasshopper Experiment,The restaurant.,Lalita,I’m sorry?

Series 01,Episode 08,The Grasshopper Experiment,The restaurant.,Lalita,"Don’t be insulting Rajesh. So, Sheldon, tell me more about this princess you say I look like."

Series 01,Episode 08,The Grasshopper Experiment,The restaurant.,Lalita,"Okay, let’s get something straight here. The only reason I came tonight was to get my parents off my case, I certainly don’t need to be getting this old world crap from you."
Series 01,Episode 08,The Grasshopper Experiment,The restaurant.,Sheldon,Exactly the kind of spirit with which Princess Punchali led the monkeys to freedom.

Series 01,Episode 10,The Loobenfeld Decay,The living room.,Leonard,I don’t know. How am I supposed to remember all of this.
Series 01,Episode 10,The Loobenfeld Decay,The living room.,Sheldon,"That’s the best part, you don’t have to, see I told Penny that you would be embarrassed, if you knew that she found out that you had lied, so she’s agreed to operate as if the original lie was still in force."
Series 01,Episode 10,The Loobenfeld Decay,The living room.,Leonard,"So she’s expecting me to lie about going to a symposium in Pasadena, when in actuality we’re pretending to go to a drug intervention in Long Beach?"

Series 01,Episode 10,The Loobenfeld Decay,The apartment.,Sheldon,Good for you.
Series 01,Episode 10,The Loobenfeld Decay,The apartment.,Penny,"Hah, yeah! Because he didn’t want Sheldon to be embarrassed, and there is nothing to be embarrassed okay, every family in America has a relative holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner."

Series 01,Episode 10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard’s bedroom. The bedside table is piled with Queen Mary memorabilia.,Sheldon,"Sadly, it’s not. Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle, but beyond that I have realised that the Leo I described would not have agreed to go to rehab."

Series 01,Episode 10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard’s bedroom. The bedside table is piled with Queen Mary memorabilia.,Sheldon,"You didn’t read the bio, did you? He’s not just a middle child, he’s the quintessential middle child, from a broken home to boot. Psychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling even to the point of self-destruction is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab."
Series 01,Episode 10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard’s bedroom. The bedside table is piled with Queen Mary memorabilia.,Leonard,I’ve got a solution.
Series 01,Episode 10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard’s bedroom. The bedside table is piled with Queen Mary memorabilia.,Sheldon,"Great, what is it?"

A moment later he comes back.)I’ve hesitated to point this out, but I must now remind you that we are in our current predicament because of your initial and totally inadequate deceit. I’m just trying to clean up after your mess.(Leonard throws a glass ornament at him. He just manages to shut the door in time.)We’ll talk in the morning."

Series 01,Episode 10,The Loobenfeld Decay,The living room. Leonard enters in his dressing gown. There is a strange man eating cereal at the kitchen table.,Man,"Au contraire. I’m 26 years old, I’m originally from(reads off crib notes)Denton, Texas, but I was a Navy brat so I was brought up on a variety of military bases around the world, as a result I’ve often felt like an outsider, never really fitting in, which is probably the reason for my substance abuse problem."
Series 01,Episode 10,The Loobenfeld Decay,The living room. Leonard enters in his dressing gown. There is a strange man eating cereal at the kitchen table.,Sheldon,"Excuse me, we just went over this. As the quintessential middle child, your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention."

Series 01,Episode 10,The Loobenfeld Decay,The living room. Leonard enters in his dressing gown.

Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The University cafeteria.,Leonard,Lay it on me.
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The University cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Assuming the device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location, and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly, you would not have actually transported the individual. You would have destroyed him in one location, and recreated him in another."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The University cafeteria.,Leonard,How about that.
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The University cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Personally, I would never use a transporter. Because the original Sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new Sheldon."

Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The University cafeteria.,Dennis,"I already know you’re not. You don’t have an open science grid computer, or a free electron laser, and the string theory research being done here is nothing but a dead end."

Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The University cafeteria.,Dennis,"I mean, the whole landscape of false vacuums in string theory could be as large as ten to the five-hundredth power. In addition… ooh, look, chocolate milk."

Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The living room of the apartment.,Sheldon,"Yes. That’s what a rational person does when his entire life’s work is invalidated by a post-pubescent Asian wunderkind. He ceases his fruitless efforts, he donates his body to scientific research, and he waits to die."

Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,"The same, later that night",Sheldon,"So I’ve decided, I’m going to collaborate with you."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,"The same, later that night",Leonard,Great.
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,"The same, later that night",Sheldon,"What exactly is it you do? I know you chatter on about it all the time, but I’ve never really paid attention."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,"The same, later that night",Leonard,"Okay, well, right now I’m designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level, but I really don’t need any help."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,"The same, later that night",Sheldon,"Oh, sure you do. Now, see, what’s this here in the schematic, is that a laser array?"
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,"The same, later that night",Leonard,Yes.
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,"The same, later that night",Sheldon,No. Hmmm. What happens if you use argon lasers instead of helium neon?
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,"The same, later that night",Leonard,It would blow up.
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,"The same, later that night",Sheldon,Are you sure?
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,"The same, later that night",Leonard,Pretty sure.
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,"The same, later that night",Sheldon,"Pretty sure’s not very scientific, is this how you normally work, just hunches and guesses and stuff?"
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,"The same, later that night",Leonard,"Okay, Sheldon, I understand that you’re going through a bit of a career crisis, you’re searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive but I need to tell you something and I want you to listen carefully."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,"The same, later that night",Sheldon,Alright.
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,"The same, later that night",Leonard,Go away.
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,"The same, later that night",Sheldon,"If you’re concerned about sharing credit with me, you’re name can go first… I’m going."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,Howard’s lab.,Howard(into phone),"It’s a small brown paper bag, Ma, I’m looking at it right now.(Pause.)Why would I make that up, there’s no ding-dong in it.(Pause.)How are two ding-dongs tomorrow going to help me today?"
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,Howard’s lab.,Sheldon(entering),"So, this is engineering, huh?"
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,Howard’s lab.,Howard(into phone),I’ll talk to you later.
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,Howard’s lab.,Sheldon,"Engineering. Where the noble semi-skilled labourers execute the vision of those who think and dream. Hello, oompah-loompahs of science."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,Howard’s lab.,Howard,"Sheldon, what are you doing here?"
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,Howard’s lab.,Sheldon,I just came by to say hello.
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,Howard’s lab.,Howard,"I’ve been at this lab for three years, you’ve never came by to say hello."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,Howard’s lab.,Sheldon,"Well, up until now I’ve had better things to do. So, what are we making today?"
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,Howard’s lab.,Howard,A small payload support structure for a European science experimental package that’s going up on the next space shuttle.
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,Howard’s lab.,Sheldon,"Really, how does it work?"
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,Howard’s lab.,Howard,"When this is done, it will be attached to the payload bay, and the sensor apparatus will rest on it."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,Howard’s lab.,Sheldon,"Uh, huh. So it’s a shelf?"
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,Howard’s lab.,Howard,"No, you don’t understand, during acceleration it needs to stay perfectly level and provide… yeah, okay, it’s a shelf."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,Howard’s lab.,Sheldon,"Now, I notice you’re using titanium, did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes, they’re lighter, cheaper and half twice the tensile strength."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,Howard’s lab.,Howard,"Sheldon, there’s a diploma in my office that says I have a masters in engineering."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,Howard’s lab.,Sheldon,"And you also have a note from your mother that says I love you, bubbula. But neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,Howard’s lab.,Howard,Sheldon.
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,Howard’s lab.,Sheldon,Yes.
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,Howard’s lab.,Howard,Go away.
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,Howard’s lab.,Sheldon,Did Leonard tell you to say that?
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,Howard’s lab.,Howard,"No, I thought of it all by myself."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,Howard’s lab.,Sheldon,Huh. It can’t be a coincidence. There must be some causal link I’m missing.

Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The apartment.,Leonard,"If he were, I wouldn’t be."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The apartment.,Raj,"Do you know what he did. He watched me work for ten minutes, and then started to design a simple piece of software that could replace me."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The apartment.,Leonard,Is that even possible?
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The apartment.,Raj,"As it turns out, yes."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The apartment.,Howard,"Something’s got to be done about him, Leonard."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The apartment.,Leonard,Like what? He’ll never be able to cope with the fact that some fifteen year-old kid is smarter and more accomplished than he is.
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The apartment.,Raj,"Well, what if something were to happen to this boy so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon?"
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The apartment.,Howard,Then our problem would be solved.
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The apartment.,Leonard,"Hang on, are we talking about murdering Dennis Kim? I’m not saying no."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The apartment.,Howard,"We don’t have to go that far, there are other means available."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The apartment.,Raj,We can’t send him back to North Korea. He knows how to get out.
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The apartment.,Howard,The only thing we need to do is make this Kim kid lose his focus.
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The apartment.,Leonard,"That won’t happen, he’s not interested in anything but physics."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The apartment.,Howard,What about biology?
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The apartment.,Leonard,What?
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The apartment.,Howard,"You know, biology? The one thing that can completely derail a world class mind."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The apartment.,Leonard,"Howard, he’s fifteen."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The apartment.,Howard,"Yeah, so, when I was fifteen I met Denise Polmerry and my grade point average fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The apartment.,Raj,She was sleeping with you?
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The apartment.,Howard,"No, I just wasted a lot of time thinking about what it would be like if she did."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The apartment.,Sheldon(entering),"Oh, good, you’re all here. Look, I’ve decided that if the three of you drop whatever it is you’re working on and join me, we could lick cold fusion in less than a decade, twelve years tops.(They stare at him.)Go away?(They nod)Hmm. Could it be me?"

Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,Outside Penny’s apartment.,Howard,We need a hot fifteen year-old Asian girl with a thing for smart guys.
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,Outside Penny’s apartment.,Penny,What?
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,Outside Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"Howard, that’s racist, any fifteen year-old girl will do the trick.(Penny slams door.)"

Since my prospects for the Nobel Prize in physics have disappeared, thank you very much, I’ve decided to refocus my efforts and use my people skills to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Look, I’m going to solve the Middle-East Crisis by building an exact replica of Jerusalem in the middle of the Mexican desert."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon’s office. He is making measurements on maps. There is a knock on the door.,Gablehouser,To what end?

Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Leonard,It’s take your daughter to work day.
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Gablehouser,"Really, I was not aware of that."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Raj,"Oh, yes. There was a very official email that was sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Gablehouser,Hm?
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Howard,Smooth.
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Raj,Thank you.
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Gablehouser,There’s the man of the hour.
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Leonard,"Okay, so we now have a socially awkward genius in a room full of attractive age-appropriate women."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Howard,"All he has to do now is hook up with one of them.(The look at Dennis, who is picking his ear.)"
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Leonard,Does anyone else see the flaw in this plan?
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Raj,We need a social catalyst.
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Leonard,Like what? We can’t get fifteen year-old girls drunk.
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Howard,Or can we?
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Leonard,"No, we can’t."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Howard,I don’t think you mean we can’t. I think you mean we shouldn’t.
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Sheldon,"Hey, Howard. You’re a Jew. If there was another wailing wall, exactly like the one in Jerusalem, but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs, would you still be able to wail at it? Okay, it’s definitely me."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Leonard,"Okay, we cannot leave this to chance, lets pick a girl, and figure out how to get her together with Dennis."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Raj,Okay. How about that one.
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Howard,"Uh-uh. I know the type, cheerleader, student council, goes out with jocks, won’t even look at anybody in the gifted programme. And if, after two years of begging, she does agree to go out with you, it turns out to be a set-up and you’re in the back seat of your mom’s car with your pants off while the whole football team laughs at you."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Raj,Are you crying?
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Howard,"No, I have allergies."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Raj,"Okay, uh, how about her?"
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Leonard,"Sure. If he wants to spend a couple of years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with non-fat White Russians, while you’re the one holding her head out of the toilet while she’s puking and telling you she wishes more guys were like you, and they she gets into Cornell because you wrote her essay for her, and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn’t even know you."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Raj,"Okay, so not her either. How about her?"
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Howard,"Interesting, kind of pretty, a little chubby so probably low self-esteem."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Leonard,I think that’s our girl. One of us should go talk to her.
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Raj,"I can’t talk to her, you do it."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Leonard,"I can’t just go up and talk to her. Howard, you talk to her."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Howard,"Oh no, she’ll never go for the kid once she gets a peek at this."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Raj,"You know, if we were in India this would be simpler. Five minutes with her dad, twenty goats and a laptop and we’d be done."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Leonard,"Well, we’re not in India."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Raj,"Alright, why don’t we do it your way then? We’ll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from Dennis so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Leonard,"Okay, that was uncalled for."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Raj,"You started it, dude."
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Gablehouser,Could I have everyone’s attention please. What a wonderful occasion this is. And how fortunate that it should happen to fall on take your daughter to work day. We’re here to welcome Mr Dennis Kim to our little family.

Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Howard,Did anyone see how he did it?
Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Sheldon(to Gablehouser),"Don’t worry, I’ve got this. Ladies and Gentlemen, honoured daughters. While Mr Kim, by virtue of his youth and naivety, has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact, let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted, and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me. Thank you."

Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Howard,I guess times have changed since we were young. Smart is the new sexy.

Series 01,Episode 12,The Jerusalem Duality,The welcoming party,Raj,Maybe we’re too smart. So smart it’s offputting.

Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Leonard,The ladies?
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Howard,"Perpetual motion squad, we can go all night."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Raj,I like it.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"I don’t. Teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures, thus intimidating ones opponent."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Raj,Then we can be the Bengal Tigers.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Poor choice. Gram for gram, no animal exceeds the relative fighting strength of the army ant."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Raj,Maybe so. But you can’t incinerate a Bengal Tiger with a magnifying glass.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Leonard,Let’s put it to a vote. All those in favour….
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Point of order. I move that any vote on team names should be unanimous. No man should be forced to emblazon his chest with the bengal tiger, when common sense dictates it should be an army ant."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Leonard,Will the gentleman from the great state of denial yield for a question?
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,I will yield.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"After we go through the exercise of an annoying series of votes, all of which the gentleman will lose, does he then intend to threaten to quit if he does not get his way?"
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,He does.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"I move we are the Army Ants, all those in favour?"
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Penny,"Good afternoon, and welcome to today’s physics bowl practice round. I’m Penny, and I’ll be your host, because apparently I didn’t have anything else to do on a Saturday afternoon, and isn’t that just a little sad? Gentlemen, are you ready?"
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Leonard,Yes.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Sheldon,Of course.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Howard,Fire away.(Raj puts his thumb up.)
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Penny,"You know, it’s none of my business, but isn’t a guy who can’t speak in front of women going to hold you back a little?"
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, uh, he’ll be okay once the women are mixed into the crowd. He only has a problem when they’re one on one and smell nice."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Penny,"Oh, thanks Raj, it’s vanilla oil."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Leonard,"I was actually the one who noticed, okay, let’s just start."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Penny,"Okay, the first question is on the topic of optics. What is the shortest light pulse ever produced? Dr Cooper."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Sheldon,"And of course, the answer is 130 adoseconds."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Penny,That is correct.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Leonard,I knew that too.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Penny,"Good for you, sweetie. Okay, next question. What is the quantum mechanical effect used to encode data on hard disk drives? Howard."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Sheldon,"And of course, the answer is giant magneto resistance."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Penny,Right.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Howard,"Hey, I buzzed in."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Sheldon,"But I answered, it’s called teamwork."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Howard,Don’t you think I should answer the engineering questions? I am an engineer.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Sheldon,By that logic I should answer all the anthropology questions because I’m a mammal.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Leonard,Just ask another one.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Penny,Okay. What artificial satellite has seen glimpses of Einsteins predicted frame dragging?(Raj buzzes.)
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Sheldon,And of course it’s Gravity Probe B.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Leonard,"Sheldon, you have to let somebody else answer."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Sheldon,Why?
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Penny,Because it’s polite.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Sheldon,What do manners have to do with it? This is war. Were the Romans polite when they salted the ground of Carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again?
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Penny,"Leonard, you said I only had to ask questions."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Sheldon,"The objective of the competition is to give correct answers, if I know them, why shouldn’t I give them?"
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Howard,Some of us might have the correct answers too.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh please, you don’t even have a PhD."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Howard,"Alright, that’s it."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Leonard,"Howard, sit down."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Howard,Okay.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Leonard,maybe we should take a little break.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Good idea, I need my wrist brace, all this button pushing is aggravating my old Nintendo injury."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Howard(after Raj whispers in his ear),I agree.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Penny,What did he say?
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Howard,He compared Sheldon to a disposable feminine cleansing product one might use on a summer’s eve.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The apartment.,Penny,"Yeah, and the bag it came in."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,"The same, later. Sheldon is on his laptop. Leonard enters.",Sheldon,"Leonard, excellent, I want to show you something."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,"The same, later. Sheldon is on his laptop. Leonard enters.",Leonard,"Can it wait, I need to talk to you."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,"The same, later. Sheldon is on his laptop. Leonard enters.",Sheldon,"Just look. I’ve designed the perfect uniforms for our team. The colours are based on Star Trek, the original series. The three of you will wear support red, and I will wear command gold."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,"The same, later. Sheldon is on his laptop. Leonard enters.",Leonard,Why do they say AA?
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,"The same, later. Sheldon is on his laptop. Leonard enters.",Sheldon,Army Ants.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,"The same, later. Sheldon is on his laptop. Leonard enters.",Leonard,Isn’t that confusing? AA might mean something else to certain people.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,"The same, later. Sheldon is on his laptop. Leonard enters.",Sheldon,Why would a physics bowl team be called anodised aluminium?
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,"The same, later. Sheldon is on his laptop. Leonard enters.",Leonard,"No, I meant…. never mind. Hey, check it out. I got you a Batman cookie jar!"
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,"The same, later. Sheldon is on his laptop. Leonard enters.",Sheldon,"Oh neat, what’s the occasion?"
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,"The same, later. Sheldon is on his laptop. Leonard enters.",Leonard,"Well, you’re a friend, and you like Batman, and cookies, and you’re off the team."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,"The same, later. Sheldon is on his laptop. Leonard enters.",Sheldon,What?
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,"The same, later. Sheldon is on his laptop. Leonard enters.",Leonard,"Howard, Raj and I just had a team meeting."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,"The same, later. Sheldon is on his laptop. Leonard enters.",Sheldon,No you didn’t.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,"The same, later. Sheldon is on his laptop. Leonard enters.",Leonard,"Yes we did, I just came from it."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,"The same, later. Sheldon is on his laptop. Leonard enters.",Sheldon,"Okay, I don’t know where you just came from, but it couldn’t have been a team meeting because I’m on the team and I wasn’t there, ergo the team did not meet."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,"The same, later. Sheldon is on his laptop. Leonard enters.",Leonard,"Okay, let me try it this way, uh, I was at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends and one thing led to another and it turns out you’re off the team."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,"The same, later. Sheldon is on his laptop. Leonard enters.",Sheldon,Why?
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,"The same, later. Sheldon is on his laptop. Leonard enters.",Leonard,Because you’re taking all the fun out of it.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,"The same, later. Sheldon is on his laptop. Leonard enters.",Sheldon,"Well, I’m sorry, is the winner of the physics bowl the team that has the most fun?"
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,"The same, later. Sheldon is on his laptop. Leonard enters.",Leonard,"Okay, let me try it this way, you’re annoying and no-one wants to play with you any more."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,"The same, later. Sheldon is on his laptop. Leonard enters.",Sheldon,"I see. Well. At this point I should inform you that I intend to form my own team and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together, and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,"The same, later. Sheldon is on his laptop. Leonard enters.",Leonard,Thanks for the heads up.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,"The same, later. Sheldon is on his laptop. Leonard enters.",Sheldon,You’re welcome. One more thing.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,"The same, later. Sheldon is on his laptop. Leonard enters.",Leonard,Yes.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,"The same, later. Sheldon is on his laptop. Leonard enters.",Sheldon,"It’s on, bitch."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Howard,So who’d he get to be on his team.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"He won’t say. He just smiles, and eats macaroons out of his bat jar."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Raj,"He’s using psychological warfare. We must reply in kind. I say we wait until he looks at us, then laugh like, yes, you are a smart and strong competitor, but we are also smart and strong and we have a reasonable chance of defeating you."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Leonard,How exactly would that laugh go?
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Raj,Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Howard,"That sounds more like, we are a tall thin woman who wants to make a coat out of your Dalmatians."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"Guys, let’s remember that Sheldon is still our friend and my room mate."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Howard,So?
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"So nothing, let’s destroy him."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Sheldon(walking past),Gentlemen.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Raj,Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Howard,"Okay, we’re going to need a strong fourth for our team."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Raj,"You know who’s apparently very smart, is the girl who played TV’s Blossom. She got a PhD in neuroscience or something."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"Raj, we’re not getting TV’s Blossom to join our physics bowl team."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Raj,How about the girl from the Wonder Years?
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Howard,"Gentlemen, I believe I’ve found the solution to all our problems."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Leonard,We can’t ask Leslie Winkle.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Raj,Why? Because you slept together and when she was done with you she discarded you like last night’s chutney?
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Leonard,Yes.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Howard,Sometimes you’ve got to take one for the team.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Raj,"Yeah. Sack up, dude."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"Fine. Here I go, taking one for the team. In the sack. Hey Leslie."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Leslie,Hi guys.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"Leslie, I have a question for you, and it might be a little awkward, you know, given that I…"
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Howard,Hit that thang.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Leslie,"Leonard, there’s no reason to feel uncomfortable just because we’ve seen each other’s faces and naked bodies contorted in the sweet agony of coitus."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"There’s not? Gee, cos it sure sounds like there should be."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Leslie,"Rest assured that any aspects of our sexual relationship regarding your preferences, your idiosyncrasies, your performance, are still protected by the inherent confidentiality of the bedroom."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"That’s all very comforting, but if it’s okay, I’d like to get on with my question now."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Leslie,Proceed.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Leonard,We are entering the physics bowl and we need a fourth for our team.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Leslie,"No thanks, I’m really busy with my like sign dilepton super symmetry search."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Howard,"Dilepton, schmilepton, we need you."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Leslie,Sorry.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Howard,"Well, we tried. Just have to face Sheldon mano-e-mano-e-mano. A-mano."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Leslie,"Wait, you’re going up against Sheldon Cooper?"
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Howard,Yes.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Leslie,"That arrogant, misogynistic East-Texas doorknob that told me I should abandon my work with high energy particles for laundry and child bearing?"
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The cafeteria.,Leonard,She’s in.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Penny,"So, how do you feel? Nice and loose? Come to play? Got your game face on?(The guys look confused.)Are you ready?"
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Leonard,"Oh, yeah. You know you don’t have to stay for the whole thing."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Penny,"Oh, no, no, I want to. It sounds really interesting."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Sheldon(entering in his Star Trek themed shirt),Gentlemen.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Leonard,Sheldon.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Howard,Sheldon.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Raj,Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Penny,Sheldon. I’m just going to sit down.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Leonard,"So, is that your team."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Sheldon,"Actually, I don’t need a team, I could easily defeat you single-handedly. But the rules require four, so may I introduce, the third floor janitor, he lady from the lunchroom, and, my Spanish is not good, either her son or her butcher. And what about your team? What rat have you recruited to the SS Sinking Ship?"
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Leslie,"Hello, Sheldon."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Sheldon,Leslie Winkle?
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Leslie,"Yeah, Leslie Winkle. The answer to the question, who made Sheldon Cooper cry like a little girl?"
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Sheldon,"Yes, well, I’m polymerised tree sap and you’re non-organic adhesive so, whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off of me, returns on its original trajectory, and adheres to you."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Leslie,"Oh, ouch."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Dr Gablehouser,"Okay, if everyone could please take your seats."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Leonard,Here’s your tee-shirt.(Hands her a tee-shirt with PMS on it. Takes jacket off to reveal similar.)
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Leslie,"PMS? It’s a couple of days early, but…"
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Leonard,"No, it stands for Perpetual Motion Squad."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Leslie,"Oh, right, of course, what was I thinking?"
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Gablehouser,"Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to this year’s physics bowl. Today’s preliminary match features two great teams… AA versus PMS."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Howard,"All night long, y’all!(Stands and turns round to reveal the back of the tee-shirt which reads “We Can Go All Night”.)"
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Gablehouser,"Okay, well let’s jump right in, first question, for ten points. What is the isospan singlet partner of the Pi Zero Meson?(Buzz)PMS?"
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Leonard,The Eta Meson.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Gablehouser,Correct.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Sheldon,Formal protest.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Gablehouser,On what grounds?
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Sheldon,The Velcro on my wrist brace caught on my shirt.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Gablehouser,"Denied. Alright, for ten points, what is the lightest element on earth with no stable isotope.(Buzz)AA?"
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Sheldon,"And of course, the answer is Technetium."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Gablehouser,"Terrific. Next question, what is the force between two uncharged plates due to quantum vacuum fluctuation.(Buzz)PMS?"
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Raj,"Sheldon can suck on, the Casimir Effect."

Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Gablehouser,"Correct. Ladies and gentlemen, I hold in my hand the final question. The score now stands AA 1150, PMS 1175. So, for one hundred points, and the match, please turn your attention to the formula on the screens. Solve the equation."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Raj,Holy crap.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Leonard,What the hell is that.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Howard,It looks like something they found on the ship at Roswell.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Leonard,"Come on, think, Leslie."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Leslie,"Leonard, it’s not going to work if you rush me, you have to let me get there."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Leonard,"You’re never going to let that go, are you?"
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Gablehouser,Ten seconds.(Buzz)PMS.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Leonard,"Sorry, I panicked."

Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,,"(Sheldon looks more and more uncomfortable, so much he is involuntarily twitching.)"
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Gablehouser,"AA, I need your answer.(Buzz)"
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Third Floor Janitor,The answer is minus eight by alpha.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Sheldon,"Hang on, hang on a second, that’s not our answer. What are you doing?"
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Third Floor Janitor,Answering question. Winning physics bowl.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Sheldon,How do you know anything about physics?
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Third Floor Janitor,"Here I am janitor, in former Soviet Union I am physicist. Leningrad Politechnica. Go Polar Bears."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Sheldon,"Well that’s a delightful little story, but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything, I answer the questions."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Third Floor Janitor,You didn’t answer question.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Sheldon,"Hey look, now maybe you have democracy now in your beloved Russia, but on this physics bowl team I rule with an iron fist.(Makes fist in the air).Ow!"
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Gablehouser,"AA, I need your official answer."
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Sheldon,Well it’s not what he said.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Gablehouser,Then what is it?
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Sheldon,I want a different question.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Gablehouser,You can’t have a different question.
Series 01,Episode 13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,The Physics Bowl.,Sheldon,Formal protest.

Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The apartment.,Raj,What did they give you?
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Turkey and roast beef with swiss and lettuce on wholewheat. It’s the right ingredients but in the wrong order. In a proper sandwich the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce. They might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash.

Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The same,Leonard,I just assumed. Who sells a full sized time machine for $800?
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The same,Sheldon,"In a venn diagram, that would be an individual located within the intersection of the sets “no longer want my time machine” and “need $800”."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The same,Howard,"It’s actually a tremendous bargain, even with shipping it works out to less than four dollars a pound."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The same,Raj,Cocktain shrimp are $12.50.
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The same,Leonard,How are we going to get it upstairs?
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The same,Howard,If we take the dish off it might fit in the elevator.
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The same,Leonard,Yes but the elevator’s been broken for two years.
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The same,Sheldon,"I’ve been meaning to ask you, do you think we should make a call about that?"
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The same,Howard,"Not necessary, I have a masters in engineering, I remotely repair satellites on a regular basis. I troubleshoot space shuttle payloads.

Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room. The time machine is set up.,Sheldon,"Hold on. Bi-monthly is an ambiguous term, do you mean move it every other month, or twice a month?"
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room. The time machine is set up.,Raj,Twice a month.
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room. The time machine is set up.,Sheldon,Then no.

Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"Later that night, Leonard is sitting in the time machine, turning the lights on and off. Sheldon enters.",Sheldon,So it’s my turn. Why did you set it for the day before yesterday?
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"Later that night, Leonard is sitting in the time machine, turning the lights on and off. Sheldon enters.",Leonard,Because I want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine.
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"Later that night, Leonard is sitting in the time machine, turning the lights on and off. Sheldon enters.",Sheldon,"You can’t. If you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past, you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it, ergo you would still have it. This is a classic rookie time travel mistake."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"Later that night, Leonard is sitting in the time machine, turning the lights on and off. Sheldon enters.",Leonard,Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to me?
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"Later that night, Leonard is sitting in the time machine, turning the lights on and off. Sheldon enters.",Sheldon,"Same paradox. If you were to travel back in time and, say, knock me unconscious, you would not then have the conversation that irritated you, motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"Later that night, Leonard is sitting in the time machine, turning the lights on and off. Sheldon enters.",Leonard,What if I knocked you unconscious right now?
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"Later that night, Leonard is sitting in the time machine, turning the lights on and off. Sheldon enters.",Sheldon,It won’t change the past.
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"Later that night, Leonard is sitting in the time machine, turning the lights on and off. Sheldon enters.",Leonard,But it would make the present so much nicer.
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"Later that night, Leonard is sitting in the time machine, turning the lights on and off. Sheldon enters.",Sheldon,Are you upset about something?
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"Later that night, Leonard is sitting in the time machine, turning the lights on and off. Sheldon enters.",Leonard,What was your first clue?
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"Later that night, Leonard is sitting in the time machine, turning the lights on and off. Sheldon enters.",Sheldon,"Well, it was a number of things. First the late hour, then your demeanour seems very low energy, plus your irritability…"
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"Later that night, Leonard is sitting in the time machine, turning the lights on and off. Sheldon enters.",Leonard,Yes I’m upset.
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"Later that night, Leonard is sitting in the time machine, turning the lights on and off. Sheldon enters.",Sheldon,Oh! I don’t usually pick up on those things. Good for me.
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"Later that night, Leonard is sitting in the time machine, turning the lights on and off. Sheldon enters.",Leonard,"Yeah, good for you."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"Later that night, Leonard is sitting in the time machine, turning the lights on and off. Sheldon enters.",Sheldon,"Oh, wait. Did you want to talk about what’s bothering you?"
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"Later that night, Leonard is sitting in the time machine, turning the lights on and off. Sheldon enters.",Leonard,I don’t know. Maybe.
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"Later that night, Leonard is sitting in the time machine, turning the lights on and off. Sheldon enters.",Sheldon,"Wow, I’m on fire tonight."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"Later that night, Leonard is sitting in the time machine, turning the lights on and off. Sheldon enters.",Leonard,"Uh, here’s the thing. Girls like Penny never end up with guys who own time machines."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"Later that night, Leonard is sitting in the time machine, turning the lights on and off. Sheldon enters.",Sheldon,I disagree. Your inability to successfully woo Penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine. That failure clearly stands on its own.
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"Later that night, Leonard is sitting in the time machine, turning the lights on and off. Sheldon enters.",Leonard,Thanks for pointing it out.
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"Later that night, Leonard is sitting in the time machine, turning the lights on and off. Sheldon enters.",Sheldon,"In addition, your premise is flawed. In the original film, Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimeaux with that very time machine. In Back to the Future, Marty McFly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"Later that night, Leonard is sitting in the time machine, turning the lights on and off. Sheldon enters.",Leonard,Those are movies.
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"Later that night, Leonard is sitting in the time machine, turning the lights on and off. Sheldon enters.",Sheldon,Well of course they’re movies. Were you expecting me to come up with an example involving a real life time machine? That’s absurd.
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"The stairwell. It is the previous day, and again Leonard and Sheldon are pulling the time machine up the stairs.",Leonard,"Come on, guys, push."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"The stairwell. It is the previous day, and again Leonard and Sheldon are pulling the time machine up the stairs.",Howard(off),If I push any harder I’m going to give birth to my colon.

It is the previous day, and again Leonard and Sheldon are pulling the time machine up the stairs.","Leonard(letting go of time machine, as does Sheldon)","Uh, hi Penny.(Raj and Howard are heard to scream as the time machine slides back down the stairs.)Take a break, guys!"
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"The stairwell. It is the previous day, and again Leonard and Sheldon are pulling the time machine up the stairs.",Penny,What are you doing?
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"The stairwell. It is the previous day, and again Leonard and Sheldon are pulling the time machine up the stairs.",Leonard,"Oh, just, you know, moving a… time machine."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"The stairwell. It is the previous day, and again Leonard and Sheldon are pulling the time machine up the stairs.",Penny,"Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so…."

It is the previous day, and again Leonard and Sheldon are pulling the time machine up the stairs.",Leonard,"No problem.(Removes glasses, pulls down out of order tape from lift doors, and forces them open.)Hang on.(Takes Penny in his arms as he holds onto the lift cable.)"
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"The stairwell. It is the previous day, and again Leonard and Sheldon are pulling the time machine up the stairs.",Penny,"But, what about your time machine."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"The stairwell. It is the previous day, and again Leonard and Sheldon are pulling the time machine up the stairs.",Leonard,Some things are more important than toys.(She puts her arms around his neck as he dangles from the cable.)
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"The stairwell. It is the previous day, and again Leonard and Sheldon are pulling the time machine up the stairs.",Penny,"Oh, I’m scared."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"The stairwell. It is the previous day, and again Leonard and Sheldon are pulling the time machine up the stairs.",Leonard,"Don’t worry baby, I’ve got you."

Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,"The stairwell. It is the previous day, and again Leonard and Sheldon are pulling the time machine up the stairs.",Sheldon,It’s still my turn.
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Sheldon,What are you doing?
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Leonard,I’m packing up all my collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell.
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Sheldon,Well is that really necessary. If you need money you can always sell blood. And semen.
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Leonard,It’s not about money.
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Raj(entering),We brought food.
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Howard,"Lox and bagels, the breakfast of time travellers."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Leonard,"Terrific, does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine?"
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Raj,Why?
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Leonard,Because I don’t want it any more.
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Howard,Why?
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Leonard,Just… personal reasons.
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Sheldon,My spidey-sense tells me this has something to do with Penny.
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Leonard,"Look, do you want to buy me out or not?"
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Raj,"I’ll give you a hundred dollars, which will make me half owner, and we’ll put it on my balcony."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Howard,"Screw his balcony, I’ll give you a hundred and twenty and we’ll put it in my garage."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Leonard,I paid two hundred dollars for my share.
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Raj,"Dude, everyone knows a time machine loses half its value the minute you drive it off the lot."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Sheldon,"I’ll go for two hundred, that time machine stays right where it is."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Raj,"Three hundred, and I’ll throw in my original 1979 Mattel Millenium Falcon with real light speed sound effects."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Leonard,"No, no more toys or action figures or props or replicas or costumes or robots or Darth Vader voice changers, I’m getting rid of all of it."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Howard,"You can’t do that, look what you’ve created here, it’s like nerdvana."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Raj,"More importantly, you’ve a Darth Vader voice changer?"
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Leonard,Not for long.
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Raj,"Oh, I call dibs on the Golden Age Flash."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Howard,"Hang on, I need that to complete my Justice Society of America collection."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Raj,"Too bad, I called dibs."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Howard,Well you can’t just call dibs.
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Raj,"I can and I did, look up dibs on Wikipedia."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Sheldon,Dibs doesn’t apply in a bidding war.
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Leonard,"It’s not a bidding war, I’m selling it all to Larry down at the comic book store."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Raj,Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs?

Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Sheldon,What’s the exchange rate.
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Raj,None of your business. Take it or leave it.
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Howard(on phone),"Mom, my bar-mizvah bonds, how much do I got? Thanks. I can go twenty six hundred dollars and two trees in Israel."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Leonard,"Forget it guys, if I sell to one of you, the other two are going to be really mad at me."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Sheldon,"Who cares, as long as you pick me."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Raj,"Okay, Leonard, put down the box, let’s talk."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Leonard,"Sorry Raj, my mind is made up."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Sheldon(moving to block his path),No. I can’t let you do this.
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Leonard,"Sheldon, get out of my way."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Sheldon(brandishing toy sword from Leonard’s box),None shall pass.
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Leonard,"Okay. I did not want to do this but, I have here the rare mint condition production error Star Trek: The Next Generation Geordi LaForge, without his visor in the original packaging.

Are you not an accumulator of Care Bears and My Little Ponies? And who is that Japanese feline I see frolicking on your shorts? Hello,Hello Kitty!"
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Penny,"Okay, okay look, if this is about yesterday, Leonard, I am really sorry about what I said, I was just a bit upset."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Leonard,"No, I needed to hear it."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Penny,"No you didn’t. Look, you are a great guy, and it is things you love that make you who you are."
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Howard,I guess that makes me large breasts.
Series 01,Episode 14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,The living room.,Leonard,"Still, I think it’s time for me to get rid of this stuff and… you know… move on with my life."

Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Leonard,How do I have Penny? In what universe do I have Penny?
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Howard,So I can have Penny?
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Leonard,"Hell, no!"
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Sheldon,"Excuse me, can I interject something. I’m ordering pizza online, is everyone okay with pepperoni?"
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Leonard,"Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?"
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Sheldon,"I guess. Don’t worry, I was going to order you cheeseless."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Leonard,Thank you.
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Sheldon,That’s okay. Lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about.

Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Leonard,"Sheldon, are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman?"
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"Hmmm? She certainly has the symmetry and low body fat that western culture deems desirable. It’s noteworth that at other points in history, heavier women were the standard for beauty because their girth suggested affluence."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Leonard,"That’s fascinating, but I…"
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"I didn’t say it was fascinating, I said it was noteworthy."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Leonard,"Alright, noted. But my point is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz… they’re hitting on your sister."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"Oh. Okay. You know, I don’t want to criticise your rhetorical style but, we’d be a lot further along in this conversation if you’d begun with that thought."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Leonard,"That’s great, but I…."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Sheldon,What I’m saying is that we took quite an unnecessary detour from what I now understand to be your thesis.
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Leonard,Whatever. You have to do something about it.
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Sheldon,Why?
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Leonard,Because she’s your sister.
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"I don’t understand. Yes, we shared a uterus for nine months, but since then we’ve pretty much gone our own separate ways."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Leonard,"Okay, uh…. oh, consider this. With your father gone, it is your responsibility to make sure that Missy chooses a suitable mate."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Sheldon,I hadn’t considered that. We do share DNA.
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Leonard,Uh-huh.
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"So there is the possibility, however remote, that resting in her loins is the potential for another individual as remarkable as myself."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Leonard,"Exactly. And, you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of your sister’s future offspring."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"You’re right. If someone wants to get at Missy’s fallopian tubes, they’ll have to go through me."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The living room. Raj and Howard are on the floor, fighting.",Raj,"I am Shiva the destroyer, I will have the woman!"
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The living room. Raj and Howard are on the floor, fighting.",Howard,"I’m warning you, I was judo champion at math camp."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The living room. Raj and Howard are on the floor, fighting.",Sheldon,"Alright, that’s enough juvenile squabbling, stop it, stop it I say. I’m going to settle this right now. Neither of you are good enough for my sister."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The living room. Raj and Howard are on the floor, fighting.",Howard,Who are you to decide that?
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The living room. Raj and Howard are on the floor, fighting.",Leonard,"He’s the man of his family, you have to respect his wishes."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The living room. Raj and Howard are on the floor, fighting.",Sheldon,"You’re out too, by the way."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The living room. Raj and Howard are on the floor, fighting.",Leonard,Say what?
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The living room. Raj and Howard are on the floor, fighting.",Sheldon,"It’s nothing personal, I’d just prefer if my future niece or nephew didn’t become flatulent every time they eat an Eskimo pie."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The living room. Raj and Howard are on the floor, fighting.","Howard(to Raj, who is smiling)",What are you so happy about?
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The living room. Raj and Howard are on the floor, fighting.",Raj,"I’m not happy, it’s the medication, I can’t stop smiling.(Waves hand at mouth. It keeps waving.)"
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The living room. Raj and Howard are on the floor, fighting.",Sheldon,"Now that Leonard’s made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are, we have to face the fact that none of you are suitable mates for my sister."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The living room. Raj and Howard are on the floor, fighting.",Howard,Wait a minute. Leonard made you aware of that?
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The living room. Raj and Howard are on the floor, fighting.",Leonard,"We all make mistakes, let’s move on."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The living room. Raj and Howard are on the floor, fighting.",Raj,"Excuse me, but I think you’re missing a big opportunity here."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The living room. Raj and Howard are on the floor, fighting.",Sheldon,How so?
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The living room. Raj and Howard are on the floor, fighting.",Raj,Everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring. Why not put a little mocha in the family latte.
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The living room. Raj and Howard are on the floor, fighting.",Sheldon,"In principle you have a point, but as a practical matter, need I remind you that it takes experimental pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The living room. Raj and Howard are on the floor, fighting.",Raj(waving finger at him),I think you’re focussing entirely too much on the drugs.(Finger keeps waving. Leonard has to reach out and stop it.)
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The living room. Raj and Howard are on the floor, fighting.",Howard,"Is it ‘cause I’m Jewish, ‘cause I’d kill my Rabbi with a porkchop to be with your sister."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The living room. Raj and Howard are on the floor, fighting.",Sheldon,"This has nothing to do with religion. This has to do with the fact that you’re a tiny, tiny man who still lives with his mother."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The living room. Raj and Howard are on the floor, fighting.",Leonard,"Sheldon, you are really being unreasonable."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The living room. Raj and Howard are on the floor, fighting.",Sheldon,Am I? Here. Eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister.
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The living room. Raj and Howard are on the floor, fighting.",Missy(who has just entered),Oh really?
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The living room. Raj and Howard are on the floor, fighting.",Sheldon,Oops.
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The living room. Raj and Howard are on the floor, fighting.",Missy,"Shelly, can I speak to you for a minute? Alone?"
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The living room. Raj and Howard are on the floor, fighting.",Sheldon,Why does everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone? Usually nobody wants to be alone with me.
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The living room. Raj and Howard are on the floor, fighting.",Leonard(to Penny who is standing next to him grinning),"We all make mistakes, let’s move on."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Missy,Okay. I’m not even going to ask why you’re pimping me out for cheese. But since when do you care at all about who I sleep with?
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"Truthfully, I’ve never given it any thought, but it has been pointed out to me that you carry DNA of great potential."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Missy,What on earth are you talking about?
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"Let me explain. You see, I’m a superior genetic mutation, an improvement on the existing mediocre stock."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Missy,"And what do you mean, mediocre stock?"
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"That would be you. But residing within you is the potential for another me. Perhaps even taller, smarter and less prone to freckling, a Sheldon 2.0 if you will."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Missy,Sheldon 2.0?
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"Exactly. Now, I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with. If you’re not attracted to the suitor then the likelihood of conception would be reduced."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Missy,You have got to be kidding me!
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Sheldon,Not at all. Frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertiliziation.
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Missy,"Okay Shelly, sit down. Now I’ve lived my whole life dealing with the fact that my twin brother is, as Mom puts it, one of God’s special little people."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird. You know, a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds. Of course the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food, leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death. Luckily for you, that’s where the metaphor ended."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Missy,"I thought it ended at cuckoo. Now you listen to me, if you want to start acting like a brother who cares about me, then terrific. Bring it on. But you try one time to tell me who I should be sleeping with, and you and I are going to go round and round the way we did when we were little. Remember?(Sheldon hurriedly crosses his legs.)"
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Sheldon,I have an alternate proposal.
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Missy,Go on.
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"You donate eggs. We will place them in cryogenic storage. I will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs, have them fertilized and implanted in you, that way everybody wins."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The living room. Sheldon enters limping, holding his groin area.",Sheldon,Correction. Missy can date whoever she wants.
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Howard,"Look, we have to settle this."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Leonard,I agree. Sheldon’s sister is hiding at Penny’s because we’ve all been hitting on her at the same time.
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Raj,"She’s not hiding. She needed privacy to call her grandmother who’s apparently very sick. Oh, and then I believe she has to wash her hair."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Howard,"Oh, you poor, deluded bastard."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Raj,Don’t start with me dude.
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Howard,You want to go again? Let’s go.
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Leonard,Sit down.
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Howard,Okay.
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Leonard,"If we’re going to fight over Missy, let’s do it the right way. The honourable way."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",,(Time shift. Sheldon enters to hear sounds of fighting. It becomes apparent that the guys are playing a boxing game on a Nintendo Wii.)
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Leonard,And he’s down!
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Howard,"Come on, come on, get up."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Leonard,"Stay down, bitch. Yeah, ha ha, natural selection at work."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Sheldon,I weep for humanity.
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Leonard,Excuse me while I go tell Missy the good news.(Leaves and knocks on Penny’s door.)
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Penny(answering),"Ah, hey Leonard."
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Leonard,"Hi Penny, how’s it going. Listen, that guy Mike that you were dating, is that still going on?"
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Penny,"Uh, pretty much, why?"
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Leonard,"Nothing, just catching up. By the way, may I speak to Missy please?"
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Penny,Of course.
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Missy,"Hi, Leonard, what’s up?"
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Leonard,"Well, since you’re leaving tomorrow I was wondering if you’d like to go out to dinner with me?"
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Missy,That’s so sweet. But no thanks.
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Leonard,"Oh. You have other plans, or…?"
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Missy,No.

Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Missy,Thanks. See you.

Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Howard,The amazing Howard. Do you like magic?
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Missy,Not really. No.
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Howard,"Then you are in for a treat. Behold, an ordinary cane.(Taps against doorpost. While humming he tries to perform a trick, but the cane falls in half with a yellow handkerchief flying out. Howard has to retrieve the pieces.)Da-dah!(Emerges with the handkerchief, on which are written the words “will you go out with me?”)"
Series 01,Episode 15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,"The same, later.",Missy,No.

Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s flat. Penny is eating ice cream from the tub.,Penny,"‘Cause I do that, I do overreact. Maybe I should call Mike and apologise."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s flat. Penny is eating ice cream from the tub.,Leonard,"No. No, no, that, that would be underreacting. He did break the implied confidentiality of the bedroom and, in your case, the elevator, parks and fast food franchise."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s flat. Penny is eating ice cream from the tub.,Penny,Yes. You’re right. I should just say I’m done with him.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s flat. Penny is eating ice cream from the tub.,Leonard,"Yes, you should, go ahead, say it."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s flat. Penny is eating ice cream from the tub.,Penny,But I never gave the man a chance to explain.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s flat. Penny is eating ice cream from the tub.,Leonard,"What is there to explain, it’s all right here, it’s a betrayal."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s flat. Penny is eating ice cream from the tub.,Penny,"No, you were right the first time, this is a man who loves me, but in his own stupid way he was just trying to show people how he feels."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s flat. Penny is eating ice cream from the tub.,Leonard,I’m pretty sure I never said that.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s flat. Penny is eating ice cream from the tub.,Penny,"No, you did better than that, you helped me see it on my own."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s flat. Penny is eating ice cream from the tub.,Leonard,"Aw, good for me. Where are you going?"
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s flat. Penny is eating ice cream from the tub.,Penny,"I’m going over to Mike’s. Leonard, thank you so much."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s flat. Penny is eating ice cream from the tub.,Leonard,"Oh, sure. Huh, maybe I am her gay friend."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The apartment. The guys are playing a board game and eating Chinese food.,Sheldon,"Howard, I’m going to need another Mandarin lesson. I obviously didn’t make my point with those people."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The apartment. The guys are playing a board game and eating Chinese food.,Howard,"For God’s sake, Sheldon, if you don’t like the tangerine chicken, don’t order the tangerine chicken."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The apartment. The guys are playing a board game and eating Chinese food.,Sheldon,"I like tangerine chicken, I’m not getting tangerine chicken."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The apartment. The guys are playing a board game and eating Chinese food.,Leonard,Can we please change the subject.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The apartment. The guys are playing a board game and eating Chinese food.,Raj,Sure. Tell us again how you screwed up and got Penny back together with her old boyfriend.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The apartment. The guys are playing a board game and eating Chinese food.,Leonard,Just roll the dice.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The apartment. The guys are playing a board game and eating Chinese food.,Raj(rolls and moves),"Enslaved by warlocks, stay here till you roll 2, 4 or 6…7"
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The apartment. The guys are playing a board game and eating Chinese food.,Leonard,"She was mad at him. She was done with him, the relationship was broken beyond repair and I walked over there and I fixed it!"
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The apartment. The guys are playing a board game and eating Chinese food.,Howard,"Boy, that story gets better every time you hear it."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The apartment. The guys are playing a board game and eating Chinese food.,Sheldon,"Actually, I thought the first two renditions were far more compelling. Previously I felt sympathy for the Leonard character, now I just find him to be whiny and annoying."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The apartment. The guys are playing a board game and eating Chinese food.,Leonard,Just eat your tangerine chicken.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The apartment. The guys are playing a board game and eating Chinese food.,Sheldon,"I’d love to, but I don’t have tangerine chicken."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The apartment. The guys are playing a board game and eating Chinese food.,Penny(storming in),Thank you so much for your stupid advice.(Slams door again.)
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The apartment. The guys are playing a board game and eating Chinese food.,Raj,Incredible. You managed to screw up the screw-up.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard(knocking and entering),I’m back.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,I’m sorry I yelled at you. It’s not your fault.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,What happened?
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Well, I went over to Mike’s to make up with him."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"Yeah, I know, I know that part."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,But he had already moved on.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"Already, that was quick."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,That’s what I said to the woman who had her legs wrapped around his neck.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, Penny, I am so sorry."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,How could he do that.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, well, you know, you did throw an 8 gig iPod… yeah, no, how could he do that."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"I swear to God, I am done with guys like that. You know, macho, with the perfect body and the hair, and the money."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"Yeah, that must get old quick."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"You know, just once, I would like to go out with someone who is nice, and honest, and who actually cares about me."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,What about me?
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,What about you what?
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,What about if you went out with me?
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,Are you asking me out?
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,Um… yes… I am… asking you out.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,Wow.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,I was just going off your comment about the nice guy…
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"No, I know, I got that. Yeah, totally."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard(continuing through Penny),"…thing and honest but, it’s no big deal…"
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,Yes.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,Yes what?
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Yes, I will go out with you."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,Really?
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Yeah. Why not, I mean, what do I have to lose?"
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,Yeah. That’s the spirit.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Sheldon,"Show me your citrus peels. Gei wo kan, ni jud di zi pei. Show me your citrus peels. Gei wo kan, ni jud di zi pei. Show me your…"
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Penny(tapping him on the shoulder),Sheldon.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Sheldon(jumping in panic),Aieee ya! Xia si wo le.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Penny,"I’m sorry. Look, do you have a second."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Sheldon,A second what? Pair of underwear?
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Penny,I was just wondering if I could talk to you? It’s about Leonard.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Sheldon,Why me? Why not Koothrappali or Wolowitz?
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Penny,"Well, Raj can’t talk to me unless he’s drunk, and Wolowitz is, you know, disgusting."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Sheldon,"Yes, I suppose he is."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Penny,"All I’m saying is, you know Leonard the best."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Sheldon,"Not necessarily. I’m often surprised by my lack of familiarity with Leonard. Just the other day I discovered, he not only has a loofah, he hides it. Why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah? I myself prefer to have my excess epithelial cells slough off naturally, but I don’t condemn those who seek to accelerate the process.(Time shift) And until recently I had no idea that despite his lactose intolerance, he can tolerate small amounts of non-fat ice cream without producing a noxious gas that I maintain in the right concentration could be weaponised.(Begins to unlock apartment door.)"
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Penny,"Leonard might come home, can we talk in my apartment."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Sheldon,We’re not done?
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Penny,No.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Sheldon,"Ach, why not? We’re already through the looking glass anyway."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Penny,"Okay, so, here’s the thing. I guess you’re aware that Leonard asked me out."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Sheldon,"Well, he didn’t actually say anything, but when he came back to the apartment he was doing a dance that brought to mind the happy hippos in Fantasia."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Penny,"Oh, that’s nice. Anyhow, the thing I wanted to talk to you about is, you know, since Leonard and I have become friends, I was just… want to sit down?"
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Sheldon,"Oh, I wish it were that simple. You see, I don’t spend much time here and so I’ve never really chosen a place to sit."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Penny,"Well, choose."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Sheldon,"There are a number of options and, I’m really not familiar enough with the cushion densities, air flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight to make an informed choice."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Penny,"Alright, why don’t you just pick one at random, and then if you don’t like it you can sit somewhere else next time."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Sheldon,"No, no, that’s crazy. You go ahead and talk while I figure it out."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Penny,"Okay. Um, here’s the thing. So, I’ve known for a while now that Leonard has had a little crush on me…"
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Sheldon,"A little crush? Well I suppose so, in the same way Menelaus had a little crush on Helen of Troy."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Penny,"Alright, yeah, I don’t really know who they are…"
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Sheldon,Well Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon…
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Penny,"Yeah, I don’t care, I don’t care. The point is Leonard isn’t the kind of guy I usually go out with."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Sheldon,Leonard isn’t the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with. Would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise thirty degrees?
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Penny,"No. What I’m saying is, Leonard might be different in a good way. Obviously my usual choices have not worked out so well."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Sheldon,"The last one worked out well for Koothrappali. He got a free iPod. Oh, glare!"
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Penny,"But on the other hand, if things don’t go well with Leonard, I risk losing a really good friend. I mean, I guess he’s not looking for a fling, he’s the kind of guy that gets into a relationship for, I don’t know, like you would say light years."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Sheldon,"I would not say that. No-one would say that, a light year is a unit of distance, not time."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Penny,Thank you for the clarification.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Sheldon,"Draft. You see people hear the word year and they think duration. Foot pound has the same problem, that’s a unit of work, not of weight."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Penny,"Right, thanks."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Sheldon,It’s a common mistake.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Penny,Not the first one I’ve made today.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Sheldon,Okay. I think this will be my seat.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Penny,"Sheldon, do you have anything to say that has anything to do with, you know, what I’m talking about."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Sheldon,"Well, let’s see. We might consider Schrodinger’s Cat."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Penny,Schrodinger? Is that the woman in 2A?
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Sheldon,"No. That’s Mrs Grossinger. And she doesn’t have a cat, she has a Mexican hairless, annoying little animal, yip yip yip yip…"
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Penny,Sheldon!
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Sheldon,"Sorry, you diverted me. Anyway, in 1935, Erwin Schrodinger, in an attempt to explain the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics, he proposed an experiment where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison that will break open at a random time. Now, since no-one knows when or if the poison has been released, until the box is opened, the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Penny,"I’m sorry, I don’t get the point."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Sheldon,"Well of course you don’t get it, I haven’t made it yet. You’d have to be psychic to get it, and there’s no such thing as psychic."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Penny,"Sheldon, what’s the point?"
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Sheldon,"Just like Schrodinger’s Cat, your potential relationship with Leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad. It is only by opening the box that you’ll find out which it is."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Penny,"Okay, so you’re saying I should go out with Leonard."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,Sheldon,"No, no, no, no, no, no. Let me start again. In 1935, Erwin Schrodinger…"
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The University cafeteria.,Leonard(pointing),Two seats right there.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The University cafeteria.,Sheldon(to two oriental-looking people occupying the other seats),Chong sho sha pwe.(Caption translates to “Long Live Concrete”.)Xie xie.(Thank you)
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The University cafeteria.,Leonard,"Sheldon, I think I’ve made a mistake."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The University cafeteria.,Sheldon,"I can see that. Unless you’re planning on running a marathon, choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes is a starch filled redundancy."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The University cafeteria.,Leonard,"No, it’s about Penny."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The University cafeteria.,Sheldon,"A mistake involving Penny? Okay, you’ll have to narrow it down."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The University cafeteria.,Leonard,I don’t think I can go out with her tonight.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The University cafeteria.,Sheldon,Then don’t.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The University cafeteria.,Leonard,Other people would say “why not?”
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The University cafeteria.,Sheldon,Other people might be interested.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The University cafeteria.,Leonard,I’m going to talk anyway.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The University cafeteria.,Sheldon,I assumed you would.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The University cafeteria.,Leonard,"Now that I’m actually about to go out with Penny, I’m not excited, I’m nauseous."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The University cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Ah, then your meal choice is appropriate. Starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The University cafeteria.,Leonard,Right.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The University cafeteria.,Sheldon,"You also made a common grammatical mistake, you said nauseous when you meant nauseated. But go on."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The University cafeteria.,Leonard,"Sheldon, this date is probably my one chance with Penny, what happens if I blow it."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The University cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Well, if we accept your premise, and also accept the highly improbable assumption that Penny is the only woman in the world for you then we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it would be that you end up a lonely, bitter old man with no progeny. The image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers from Scooby Doo cartoons comes to mind."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The University cafeteria.,Leonard,You’re not helping.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The University cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Alright, what response on my part would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion?"
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The University cafeteria.,Leonard,Tell me whether or not to go through with the date.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The University cafeteria.,Sheldon,Schrodinger’s Cat.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The University cafeteria.,Leonard,"Wow, that’s brilliant."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The University cafeteria.,Sheldon,"You sound surprised. Mmm, hou zi shui zai li du.(Your monkey sleeps inside me.)"
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard approaches Penny’s door. He is wearing a suit. He knocks. Penny answers.,Penny,Hi.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard approaches Penny’s door. He is wearing a suit. He knocks. Penny answers.,Leonard,Hi.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard approaches Penny’s door. He is wearing a suit. He knocks. Penny answers.,Penny,come on in.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard approaches Penny’s door. He is wearing a suit. He knocks. Penny answers.,Leonard,Thank you. You look very nice.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard approaches Penny’s door. He is wearing a suit. He knocks. Penny answers.,Penny,Thank you. So do you.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard approaches Penny’s door. He is wearing a suit. He knocks. Penny answers.,Leonard,I made an eight o’clock reservation.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard approaches Penny’s door. He is wearing a suit. He knocks. Penny answers.,Penny,"Okay, great, listen, um, maybe we should talk first."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard approaches Penny’s door. He is wearing a suit. He knocks. Penny answers.,Leonard,"Oh. Okay. But before you say anything, have you ever heard of Schrodinger’s Cat?"
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard approaches Penny’s door. He is wearing a suit. He knocks. Penny answers.,Penny,"Actually, I’ve heard far too much about Schrodinger’s Cat."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard approaches Penny’s door. He is wearing a suit. He knocks. Penny answers.,Leonard,Good.(He grabs her and kisses her.)
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard approaches Penny’s door. He is wearing a suit. He knocks. Penny answers.,Penny,"Alright, the cat’s alive, let’s go to dinner."
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The Szechuan Palace.,Sheldon(in Mandarin),Show me your mucus! Your mucus!
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The Szechuan Palace.,Owner(in Mandarin),Blow your own nose and go away.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The Szechuan Palace.,Sheldon(in Mandarin),This is not a tangerine bicycle.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The Szechuan Palace.,Owner(in English),Crazy man. Call the police.
Series 01,Episode 17,The Tangerine Factor,The Szechuan Palace.,Sheldon(in Mandarin),"No. Don’t call the library. Show me your mucus.(Leonard and Penny are seen entering, and then leaving again quickly.)Oxen are in my bed! Many, many oxen! Oy Vey!"
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,"So you see, what you’re eating is not technically yoghurt, because it doesn’t have enough live acidophilus cultures. It’s really just iced milk with carragenin added for thickness."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Penny,"Oh, that’s very interesting."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,It’s also not pink and has no berries.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Penny,"Yeah, but it doesn’t really answer my question."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,What was your question again?
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Penny,Do you want some.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Oh, right, no, I’m lactose intolerant."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Penny,Right.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,"So, gas."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Penny,Got it.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Well, good night.(They kiss. Camera cuts away to a wall mounted security cam above the lift. Leonard spots its movement and shuffles Penny away.)"
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Penny,What are you doing?
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,There was a draft.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Penny,I didn’t feel a draft.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,Why don’t we just go into your….
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Penny,"Oh, yeah, you know what, maybe we should just slow things down a little."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,"No, no, I didn’t mean to go into your apartment to… go fast."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Penny,"No, I know, I… I know what you meant, it’s just… it’s only our first date."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Yeah, okay, sure, no problem, why don’t we just figure out where we’re going, and when we want to get there, and then rate of speed equals distance over time. Solve for R."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Penny,Or we could just wing it.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,That might work too.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Penny,Goodnight Leonard.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,Goodnight.(He throws the camera a dirty look.)
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,,Cut to inside the apartment.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Raj,He’s coming. Screen saver.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Howard,"Oh, hey, Leonard, how was your date?"
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Bite me. Sheldon, how could you just sit there and let them spy on me?"
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"They were clever, Leonard. They exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Howard,"You should thank us. When future generations try to determine why your relationship with Penny crashed and burned, this right here is the black box."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,"What are you talking about, the date went fine."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Raj,"Dude, she said she wants to slow things down."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Okay, so, she said she wants to slow things down. It’s like saying “I’m really enjoying this meal, I’m going to slow down and savour it.”"
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Howard,"No, it’s like “this fish tastes bad, so I’m going to slow down and spit it out.”"
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Raj,You being the fish.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,I’m not the fish.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Howard,"Oh really, did you make a second date."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Well, we sort of decided to wing it."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Oh, even I know that’s lame."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Okay, alright, let’s assume your hypothesis. We went to dinner, we talked, we laughed, we kissed, where could I have possibly gone wrong."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Howard,"Think back, Leonard, the littlest things can set women off. Like, hey, the waitress is hot, I bet we could get her to come home with us. Or, how much does your mom weigh, I want to know what I’m getting into."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,I didn’t say anything like that.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Howard,"Good, ‘cos they don’t work."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Raj,"They also don’t care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate. Sadly, that’s my home run swing."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Look, everything went fine. I didn’t even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters. The woman across the hall is into me."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Howard,"Let’s go to the tape. Look at her reaction to the goodnight kiss, no change in respiration, pupils un-dilated, no flushing of the chest."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Raj,"Nice close up, by the way."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Interesting, her jaws are clenched, no tongue access, clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,That’s not a bad sign.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Please, you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Raj,"And the worst sign of all is, you’re here and not there."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,"I’m not there because I’m taking things slow. Which, by the way, compared to you guys approaches warp speed. And take down that camera."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Raj,He was a lot more fun when he had no hope.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Howard,Give him time.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,,Credits sequence
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Penny(entering),Hi.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Sheldon,"Oh, hi Penny. FYI, the hot water is inadequate on machine 2 so colours only, and 4 is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle so I’d avoid using that for your delicates."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Penny(tipping all her laundry into one machine at once),Thanks.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Sheldon,"Oh, good Lord. Why don’t you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock?"
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Penny,"Sheldon, may I ask you a question?"
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Sheldon,"I would prefer that you not, but I won’t go so far as to forbid it."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Penny,"Alright, I heard yes, so… okay, here’s my question, has Leonard ever dated, you know, a regular girl."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Sheldon,Well I assume you’re not referring to digestive regularity? Because I’ve come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Penny,"No, I meant has he ever been involved with someone who wasn’t a braniac?"
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Sheldon,"Oh. Well, a few years ago he did go out with a woman who had a PhD in French Literature."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Penny,How is that not a braniac?
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Sheldon,"Well, for one thing, she was French. For another, it was literature."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Penny,"So, do you think that if Leonard and I keep dating he’ll eventually get bored with me."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Sheldon,That depends.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Penny,On what?
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Sheldon,Do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics?
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Penny,No.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Sheldon,Do you speak Klingon?
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Penny,No.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Sheldon,Do you know any card tricks?
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Penny,"Okay, okay, you know, I get it, Leonard has no business being involved with a waitress slash actress who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Sheldon,Why would you lie about that?
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Penny,"Well, he was going on and on about this college and that grad school and I didn’t want him to think I was some stupid loser."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Sheldon,You thought the opposite of stupid loser was community college graduate?
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Penny,"You know, there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Sheldon,"Yeah, but you were neither."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Penny,"Right, okay look, this is between you and me, you cannot tell Leonard any of this."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Sheldon,You’re asking me to keep a secret?
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Penny,Yeah.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Sheldon,"Well I’m sorry, but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret, so that I could choose whether or not I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping. You can’t impose a secret on an ex post facto basis."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Penny,What?
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Sheldon,"Secret keeping is a complicated endeavour. One has to be concerned not only about what one says, but about facial expression, autonomic reflexes, when I try to deceive, I myself have more nervous tics than a lyme disease research facility.(Long pause.)It’s a joke. It relies on the hominymic relationship between tick the blood-sucking arachnid, and tic the involuntary muscular contraction. I made it up myself."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Penny,"Okay, look, if Leonard finds out that I lied, I will absolutely die of embarrassment."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Sheldon,Physiologically impossible.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Penny,"Oh Sheldon, please, look, I’m asking you as a friend."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Sheldon,So you’re saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences?
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Penny,"Well, yeah."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.,Sheldon,"Interesting. See, one more question, and perhaps I should have led with this, when did we become friends?"
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"I.e, I couldn’t become Green Lantern unless I was chosen by the guardians of Oa, but given enough start-up capital and an adequate research facility, I could be Batman."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,You could be Batman?
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Sheldon,Sure.(In a gravelly voice)I’m Batman. See.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Penny(arriving),Hi guys.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,Hey.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Sheldon(looking the other way uncomfortably),Hi Penny.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Hey, Penny, if you’re not doing anything Friday night I thought maybe we could go and see a movie."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Penny,"Oh, um, you know, I think I have the dinner shift on Friday."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,What about Saturday?
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Penny,"You know, I’m not sure, the manager hasn’t posted the schedule yet, how about I let you know."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Great. So you just let me know when you know. So…(she leaves)Oh God, I am the bad fish! What did I do wrong?"
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Why are you asking me, I have no information about your interactions with Penny other than what you provided me, nor do I have any method of learning such things.(Runs away.)"
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard(chasing him),What does that mean?
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Sheldon,Nothing. You seem to be implying an informational back channel between me and Penny where obviously none exists.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,No I didn’t.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"I just think you need to be careful how you phrase things, sir."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,What’s going on with you?
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Sheldon,Well I might ask you the same question. Why do you insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me? But exist between you and Penny. A person to whom I barely speak.(His eye begins to twitch.)
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,What’s wrong with your face?
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"There’s no reason to bring my looks into this. Good day, Leonard."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,What?
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Sheldon,I said Good Day!(He leaves)
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The stairwell.,Leonard,Good day?
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The Cheesecake Factory,Penny,"Also today we have a fresh caught Alaska salmon, and that’s served with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice. Our soup of the day…"
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The Cheesecake Factory,Sheldon(appearing behind her),You must release me from my oath.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The Cheesecake Factory,Penny,"Sheldon, I’m working."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The Cheesecake Factory,Sheldon,Why don’t you take a minute to decide(leads her away)I can’t keep your secret Penny. I’m going to fold like an energy based anobo protein in conformational space. Like a renaissance triptych. Like a cheap suit.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The Cheesecake Factory,Penny,"Oh, look, why is it so hard for you to keep one little secret?"
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The Cheesecake Factory,Sheldon,"I’m constitutionally incapable. That’s why I was refused clearance for a very prestigious government research fellowship at a secret military supercollider, located beneath a fake agricultural station 12.5 miles south east of Travers City, Michigan. Which you did not hear about from me."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The Cheesecake Factory,Penny,"Look, just forget I told you about me not graduating from community college. Okay?"
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The Cheesecake Factory,Sheldon,Forget! You want me to forget? This mind does not forget. I haven’t forgotten a single thing since the day my mother stopped breast feeding me. It was a drizzly Tuesday.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The Cheesecake Factory,Penny,"Okay, look, you promised me you would keep my secret so you’re just going to have to figure out a way to do it."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Sheldon(entering),"Leonard, I’m moving out."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Leonard,"What do you mean, you’re moving out? Why?"
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Sheldon,There doesn’t have to be a reason.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Leonard,"Yeah, there kind of does."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Not necessarily. This is a classic example of munchausen’s trilemma. Either the reason is predicated on a series of sub-reasons leading to an infinite regression, or it tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements, or it’s ultimately circular, i.e., I’m moving out because I’m moving out."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Leonard,I’m still confused.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Leonard, I don’t see how I could have made it any simpler."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Howard(entering),"Hey, qu’est q’wass up?"
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Raj,We just got back from that exhibit of those plasticised human cadavers.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Howard,And some of those skinless chicks were hot.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Sheldon,"If you’ll excuse me, I’m going to pack."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Howard,That’s kind of an overreaction to a little harmless necrophilia.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Leonard,"It’s not you, Howard, he says he’s moving out."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Raj,What did you do? Did you change the contrast or brightness settings on the television?
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Leonard,No.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Raj,Did you take a band aid off in front of him?
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Leonard,No.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Howard,"Did you buy generic ketchup, forget to rinse the sink, talk to him through the bathroom door?"
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Raj,"Adjust the thermostat, cook with cilantro, pronounce the T in often?"
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Leonard,No.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Howard,Did you make fun of trains?
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Leonard,"I didn’t do anything, he’s just gone insane."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Raj,"Well, we all knew this day was coming."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Leonard,That was fast.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Sheldon,It’s my pre-packed disaster evacuation bag. Recommended by the department of homeland security. And Sarah Connor.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Leonard,Where are you gonna live?
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Sheldon,Until I find a permanent place I will stay with friends.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Howard,Bye(runs out.)
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Raj,"Well you can’t stay with me, I have a teeny tiny apartment."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Excuse me, but isn’t hosting guests an aspect of Menushya Yajna, one of the five central religious duties or sacrifices of the Hindu householder?"
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Raj,I hate trains.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Don’t be ridiculous, you love trains."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Raj,"Yes I do, come on. See you later Leonard.(Sheldon drops keys in bowl and leaves without a word.)"
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,The apartment.,Leonard,This could work.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Raj’s apartment.,Sheldon,This is a very old building.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,Sixty years. Used to be a watch factory.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Raj’s apartment.,Sheldon,Uh-oh.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,What?
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Raj’s apartment.,Sheldon,Don’t you worry about the residual radium from the luminous dials?
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,Not until now.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Raj’s apartment.,Sheldon,"I can’t believe I didn’t bring my gieger counter. You know, I had it on my bed and I didn’t pack it."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Well, if you’re not comfortable staying here, Sheldon…"
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Raj’s apartment.,Sheldon,"I’m kidding, I packed it. It was a joke, I was subverting the conversational expectations. I believe they call that the, um, old switcheroo."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,Terrific.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Raj’s apartment.,Sheldon(referring to Bollywood singing on television),Is that woman Aishwarya Rai?
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Yes, isn’t she an amazing actress."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Raj’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Actually, I’d say she’s a poor man’s Madhuri Dixit."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,How dare you. Aishwarya Rai is a Goddess. By comparison Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Raj’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you. Obviously you’re not that familiar with Indian cinema."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Howard’s house. The door rings.,Howard,Who is it?
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Howard’s house. The door rings.,Voice,Strippergram.(Howard opens door. Outside are Raj and Sheldon.)
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Howard’s house. The door rings.,Raj,Tag. You’re it.(Runs away.)
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Howard’s house. The door rings.,Howard,Shouldn’t you have put him in a brown paper bag and set him on fire?
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,"Howard’s bedroom. Howard is in bed, Sheldon is on a blow up mattress on the floor.",Sheldon,I’ve never slept on an air mattress before. No lumbar support whatsoever.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,"Howard’s bedroom. Howard is in bed, Sheldon is on a blow up mattress on the floor.",Howard,Maybe you’d be happier on a park bench?
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,"Howard’s bedroom. Howard is in bed, Sheldon is on a blow up mattress on the floor.",Sheldon,I don’t see any way to get a park bench in here.
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,"Howard’s bedroom. Howard is in bed, Sheldon is on a blow up mattress on the floor.",Howard,Do you want to switch?
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,"Howard’s bedroom. Howard is in bed, Sheldon is on a blow up mattress on the floor.",Sheldon,"No, that’s fine. I’m perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle."
Series 02,Episode 01,The Bad Fish Paradigm,"Howard’s bedroom. Howard is in bed, Sheldon is on a blow up mattress on the floor.",Howard,"Get out of bed, we’re switching."

Series 06,Episode 01,The Date Night Variable,The university cafeteria.,Sheldon,"You don’t even know what it is, do you?

Series 06,Episode 01,The Date Night Variable,The university cafeteria.,Leonard,I know what the anthropic principle is.

Series 06,Episode 01,The Date Night Variable,The university cafeteria.,Sheldon,"As I’ve stated before on numerous occasions, the only sea creature I would even consider being eaten by is the Kraken, because the last words I would hear are “Release the Kraken.” That never gets old. “Release the Kraken!” Oh, chills.

Series 06,Episode 01,The Date Night Variable,The International Space Station,Howard,"Okay, okay, I know you’re upset, but let me share something I’ve learned since I got here.

Series 06,Episode 01,The Date Night Variable,The apartment.,Penny,This is great. What’s the occasion?
Series 06,Episode 01,The Date Night Variable,The apartment.,Leonard,"No occasion. You know, things have been a little weird between us, so I wanted to throw together a fun night just for you."

Series 06,Episode 01,The Date Night Variable,The apartment.,Raj,"Now, don’t blame yourself. He was a groveller from way back. But the point is, the two of you got past it. And, Leonard, you go and propose to this poor girl in the middle of sex? That was some weak tea, dude."
Series 06,Episode 01,The Date Night Variable,The apartment.,Leonard,Some people might say it was romantic.

Series 06,Episode 01,The Date Night Variable,The apartment.,Raj,"I’m just saying that after everything you’ve been through, you get to look into each other’s eyes and say “I love you.” And that’s beautiful."
Series 06,Episode 01,The Date Night Variable,The apartment.,Leonard,"Actually, to this day, she’s never really said it."
Series 06,Episode 01,The Date Night Variable,The apartment.,Raj,"Oh, Penny. That’s ridiculous. You know you love him. You, you look him in the eyes and you say it."

Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Penny,No. Yeah. But you know what the second-worst part is? He does not miss me at all.
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Sheldon,Allow me to comfort you. At least you’ve got your health.
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Penny,"Really? That, that’s it? That’s comforting?"
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Um, uh, in a hundred years, you’ll both be dead and it won’t matter?"
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Penny,"No. Come on, you’re supposed to say, of course he misses you, the only reason he’s partying is to cover up his pain."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, no, I don’t think that’s true at all."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Penny,This is ridiculous. Why am I upset just because he’s off having a good time?
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, perhaps you’re obsessively picturing him engaged in drunken coitus with another woman. Is that it? Did I get it right?"
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Penny,"Okay, that, that’s great. You can stop trying to make me feel better now."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Actually, I can’t. Before Leonard left, he made me promise that I’d take care of you."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Penny,He did?
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Sheldon,Yes.
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Penny,"Oh, that’s really sweet."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Plus, if I do a good job, he said he’d bring me back a sailor’s cap."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Penny,"Well, now I miss him even more."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, if it’s any consolation, I’m sure Leonard’s tormented every moment he’s away from your warm embrace and cherry lips."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Penny,Thanks.
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, seriously?"
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The mixer.,Raj,"Uh, excuse me, Mrs. Davis?"
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The mixer.,Mrs Davis,What?
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The mixer.,Raj,"I’d like to apologize for being insensitive. And for possibly making penguins seem like jerks, because 99% of them are stand-up guys."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The mixer.,Mrs Davis,Forget about it.
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The mixer.,Raj,"You know, you, you and I, you and I have a lot in common."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The mixer.,Mrs Davis,Is that right?
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The mixer.,Raj,"Oh, yes, I, I too am in the throes of heartbreak. Okay, fine, I’ll tell you about it."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Sheldon,Here is a hot beverage to comfort you. It’s in a to-go cup. Make of that what you will.
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Penny,Come on. It’s still early. Let’s do something.
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, I have been toying around with an idea for 4D chess."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Penny,How about we just talk?
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Sheldon,All right. In 4D chess…
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Penny,"No. Come on, let’s talk about our lives. Tell me something about you I don’t know."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Sheldon,I own nine pairs of pants.
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Penny,"Okay, that, that’s a good start, but I was thinking maybe something a little more personal."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Sheldon,I see. I own nine pairs of underpants.
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Penny,How about I go first?
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Sheldon,"But I don’t want to know how many underpants you own. Although, based on the floor of your bedroom, I’d say it’s a thousand."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Penny,"Okay, look, here’s something people do not know about me. When I first moved out to L.A., I did a topless scene in a low-budget horror movie about a killer gorilla. Ugh! After I did it, I felt so ashamed. Thankfully, that thing never came out."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Sheldon,I’ve seen that. Yeah. Serial Apeist. Howard found it online the day we met you.
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Penny,"Oh, God."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Sheldon,"And it was literally the moment you walked out the door. But I see the type of personal revelations you’re going for. Okay, here’s one I thought I’d take to the grave."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Penny,Okay.
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Hmm. A while back, YouTube changed its user interface from a star-based rating system to a thumbs-up rating system. I tell people I’m okay with it, but I’m really not."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Penny,That’s your big revelation?
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Yes. Whew, I feel ten pounds lighter."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Penny,"Okay, you know what? I give up. I’m going to bed."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Sheldon,Here’s something else you don’t know about me. You just hurt my feelings.
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Penny,What did I do?
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Sheldon,"I opened up and shared something deeply upsetting to me, and you treated it as if it were nothing."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Penny,"I, I didn’t think it was a big deal."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Sheldon,It is to me; that’s the point.
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Penny,"Sheldon, you are right. I’m really sorry. I should’ve known better."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Sheldon,Your apology is accepted.
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Penny,Thank you. How about a hug?
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Sheldon,How about a hearty handshake?
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Penny,Come on.
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The apartment.,Sheldon,Now I know how you felt getting mauled by that sex-crazed gorilla.
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The hotel room.,Bernadette,Good night.
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The hotel room.,Amy,Mm-hmm. It was rather flattering to have strangers send us drinks.
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The hotel room.,Bernadette,"Yeah, that felt nice."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The hotel room.,Amy,Maybe tomorrow morning we put on some hot pants and see if we can score us some free omelettes.
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The hotel room.,Bernadette,"So, hypothetically, if, if we were to have gone with them, which one would you have picked?"
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The hotel room.,Amy,I think I would have gone with the short one with the goofy haircut.
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The hotel room.,Bernadette,"Oh, good, ’cause I liked the tall thin one. He seemed intelligent, kind of a loner, maybe a little sexually inexperienced, like I’d have to teach him a thing or two."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The hotel room.,Amy,"Not my guy. I caught him staring at my rack. It’d be nice to be with a man who wants to know what’s underneath my cardigan. FYI, it’s another cardigan."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The hotel room.,Bernadette,Your short sexed-up guy kind of sounds like Howard.
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The hotel room.,Amy,Your brainy virgin kind of sounds like Sheldon.
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The hotel room.,Both,Good night.
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The mixer.,Mrs Davis,"All right, Dr. Koothrappali, it’s been nice talking to you, but I need to go home and relieve my babysitter."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The mixer.,Raj,"Yeah, I can relate to being a single parent. I have a dog."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The mixer.,Mrs Davis,"Yeah, it’s exactly the same thing. Good night."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The mixer.,Raj,"Mrs. Davis, I, uh, I must confess, I came here tonight in a futile attempt to pick up some lonely postdoc, but instead I got to connect with you at a human level. That’s a much better evening. You’re a lovely person."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The mixer.,Mrs Davis,Are you hitting on me?
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The mixer.,Raj,"No, no, no, that would be crazy. I mean, if I were hitting on you, you’d know it ’cause you’d feel uncomfortable and a little sad for me."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The mixer.,Mrs Davis,"You’re sweet. Good night, Dr. Koothrappali."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The mixer.,Raj,Good night.
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The mixer.,Howard,Looks like she accepted your apology.
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The mixer.,Raj,And then some. I think we had a moment.
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The mixer.,Howard,"Oh, please, you did not have a moment."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The mixer.,Raj,Who died and made you king of moments?
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The mixer.,Howard,"Okay, fine. Let’s say there was a moment."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The mixer.,Raj,There was.
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The mixer.,Howard,"There wasn’t. But, but even if there was, what are you gonna do about it?"
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The mixer.,Raj,"I will slowly seduce her until she falls helpless into my bed, hungry for the pleasure only I can give her."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The mixer.,Howard,So nothing.
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,The mixer.,Raj,"No, not a thing."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,A bathroom shower.,Penny(acting),"Ah, I’m so glad the police finally caught that psychotic genetically engineered ape."
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,A bathroom shower.,Leonard(on ship),That is my girlfriend. I swear to God.
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,A bathroom shower.,Everyone(on ship),Leonard! Leonard! Leonard! Leonard!
Series 07,Episode 01,The Hofstadter Insufficiency,A bathroom shower.,Penny,Aaaaaaah!
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell,Sheldon,And here’s another interesting weather fact.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell,Penny,Another? Great.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell,Sheldon,"Changes in jet streams can affect the speed at which the Earth rotates on its axis, so bad weather can actually make the day longer."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell,Penny,"Well, there must be a hell of a storm somewhere."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell,Sheldon,"Joke if you must, but you’re going to miss these moments. With Leonard home in a few days, this was your last time driving me to the grocery store."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell,Penny,"You know, I will miss this."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell,Sheldon,"I’ll tell you what, if my apples are mealy, we’ll hit the produce section for one last crazy blowout. Heck, you can even push the cart. Please don’t take my looking forward to Leonard’s return as criticism of the job you’ve been doing in his absence."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell,Penny,I won’t.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell,Sheldon,That criticism will come later in your report card.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell,Penny,"Yeah, I didn’t stay for the detention, I’m not gonna read the report card."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell,Leonard(in Penny’s apartment),Hello.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell,Penny(screams),Leonard! Hi!
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell,Leonard,Keep your voice down.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell,Penny,"Oh, my God. You weren’t supposed to be here till Sunday."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell,Leonard,"We finished the experiment early, so I thought I’d come home and surprise you."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell,Penny,"Oh, my gosh, why are we whispering?"
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell,Leonard,"I didn’t tell Sheldon, so we could have a few days alone."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell,Penny,"Oh, that is so romantic."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell,Leonard,"Uh, sure, that’s why I did it."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell,Penny,"Oh, I just cannot believe you’re here."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell,Sheldon(off),"Penny, it’s your lucky day. Three of the eggs are clearly not jumbo. Grab your keys."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell,,Credits sequence.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The comic book store.,Sheldon,"Uh, Stuart, I was wondering if you could help me find something."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The comic book store.,Stuart,"Happy to, unless it’s hope or a reason to live."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The comic book store.,Sheldon,"Oh, you make me laugh, sad clown. Anyhoo, Leonard will be back in a couple days and I need a welcome home gift for him. As he’s been at sea, perhaps something with a nautical theme might be appropriate."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The comic book store.,Stuart,"Okay, well, I don’t know how much you want to spend, but I do have this pretty cool Aquaman statue."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The comic book store.,Sheldon,"Aquaman? Oh, this isn’t a gag gift, Stuart."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The comic book store.,Stuart,"Yeah, just as well. It’s a pretty rare piece. I’d rather just sell it to a real collector."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The comic book store.,Sheldon,I’m a real collector. How rare is it?
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The comic book store.,Stuart,"Oh, I shouldn’t even have mentioned it. How about a Batman squirt gun?"
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The comic book store.,Sheldon,Don’t try and trick me into buying something I don’t want. Now let’s talk Aquaman.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The comic book store.,Howard,"What were they thinking, putting Doctor Octopus’s mind in Spider-Man’s body?"
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The comic book store.,Raj,"Well, I’ve been quite enjoying that. It combines all the superhero fun of Spider-Man with all the body-switching shenanigans of Freaky Friday. Both versions, original and Lohan."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The comic book store.,Howard,Both versions: original and Lohan. You’re an idiot.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The comic book store.,Raj,"Hey, what’s your problem?"
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The comic book store.,Howard,"I’m sorry, I’ve been kind of snippy lately. It’s probably this stupid diet I’m on."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The comic book store.,Raj,Why are you on a diet?
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The comic book store.,Howard,I’ve put on a couple pounds. Had to buy these pants in the men’s section.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The comic book store.,Raj,"Well, we’ve all seen your mom. That Butterball turkey was bound to come home to roost."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The comic book store.,Sheldon,Twelve hundred dollars. That’s my final offer.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The comic book store.,Stuart,"All right, Sheldon, you win. I’m sure Leonard is gonna love this."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The comic book store.,Sheldon,"Oh, right, a present for Leonard. You better throw in that squirt gun."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The comic book store.,Stuart,"Ooh, yeah, I don’t know. This squirt gun, it’s, uh, it’s pretty rare."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The comic book store.,Sheldon,Oh.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,And this is me doing the Titanic pose on the boat.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,Ah.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"And, oh, that’s me getting rescued after I fell in."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Oh.(Knock on door)Oh, that’s the pizza."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,Yep. Here’s some money.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,Thank you.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,And I’m gonna hit the head. That’s what us salty sea dogs say when we have to go pee-pee.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,Hey.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Pizza guy,Twenty-two fifty.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Okay, here’s, uh, twenty-five. Keep the change."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Pizza guy,"Seriously? I just walked up, like, four flights of stairs."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Oh. Okay. Well, here’s, um, thirty something cents and a promise I won’t call your boss and tell him you reek of marijuana."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, Penny, I see you’ve ordered pizza. I have Chinese food."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,That’s nice.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, that’s a rather earthy cologne. My uncle used to wear that. Perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together before Leonard returns."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Yeah, thanks, but I kind of feel like eating alone tonight, so…"
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Are you sure? With your Italian pizza and my Chinese noodles, we could play Marco Polo. I mean, of course, a re-enactment of a meal in the life of Marco Polo the Venetian explorer, not Marco Polo the terrifying water sport."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Uh, yeah, it sounds fun, but no thanks.(Toilet flushes)Have a good night!"
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,"What, now, do you have company?"
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"No. No, no, no. You know what? The toilet’s been doing that. I called the building manager, so…"
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, I can take a look at it."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,Well…
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,"I’m quite familiar with plumbing. Not to brag, but I spent most of fifth grade with my head in a toilet."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Yeah, no, no, no. You know what, Sheldon, it’s okay. You don’t have to go into the bathroom."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,"That’s curious. If there’s no one here, why are there two glasses of wine on the table?"
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Oh. Well, you know, I, I’ve got two hands and a bit of a drinking problem."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,Of course. Ask a silly question.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,Oh.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,That’s odd.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Um, what?"
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,There are takeout containers in the trash can.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,So? That’s my dinner from last night.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,What’s odd is they’re in the trash can.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Okay. Look, honey, I promise there’s no one’s here.I‘ve had a long day. I just want to have a quiet dinner by myself."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, very well. I’m no stranger to enjoying the pleasures of solitude. Oh!"
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,What?
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,Have you gotten Leonard a welcome-home gift yet?
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,No.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, great. Do you want to go halfsies on a two hundred dollar squirt gun?"
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,"Hi, honey."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,Hey.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,I made some brownies. You want one?
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,"You’re kidding, right? I mean, you know I’m trying to lose weight. God, I thought we were partners in this marriage."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,"We are. Stop it. And for the last time, you’re not fat."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,"Really? Tell that to the bathroom scale, ’cause one of you is lying."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,"Fine, forget I asked. How was dinner at your mom’s?"
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,Awful. I had to rub her ointment all over her again.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,Why can’t she do it?
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,"‘Cause we’ve got a deeply unhealthy relationship. Which reminds me, do you think you can get any samples of this from work? This was supposed to last her a month, but they didn’t take into account the square footage of her back."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,Let me see. How long have you been putting this on her?
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,I don’t know. Few weeks. Why?
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,This is really strong oestrogen cream. Please tell me you’ve been wearing gloves.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,Like these swollen sausages could fit in gloves.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,"Howie, the oestrogen’s getting absorbed by your skin. That’s why you’ve been all bloated and moody and a giant pain in the ass."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,You’re full of oestrogen and you don’t act like that.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,That’s ’cause I’m a woman. I’ve had years of practice riding the dragon.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,Fine. I’ll wear gloves next time.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,It’s still gonna take a few weeks for the hormones to leave your system.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,I feel so stupid. And fat.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,"It’s okay. You still look great to me. In fact, why don’t we go in the bedroom and I’ll prove it to you?"
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,"Sex? Really? I mean, that’s just your solution to everything."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Amy,"Oh, and here’s a fun thing. I worked it out so that there are two different words for spoon, planko and janko. Planko is a spoon with food, janko is a spoon without food. Janko is spelled with a silent ptang. Sheldon, you’re not even listening to the rules of my made-up language."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Yes, I am."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Amy,Then what does tweepadock mean?
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Uh, elephant?"
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Amy,Lucky guess.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Sheldon,I’m sorry. I’m just distracted by something that happened over at Penny’s.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Amy,What happened?
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Sheldon,I fear Penny is being unfaithful to Leonard.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Amy,What?
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Sheldon,"She claimed to be alone when there was obviously someone else in her apartment. I have no choice but to assume the worst, given Leonard’s lengthy sea voyage and her famously ravenous nether regions."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Amy,I don’t think Penny would cheat on Leonard.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, really? She and I once had a staring contest. She clapped really loud and made me blink. It’s a small leap from there to sexual infidelity."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Amy,You’re being ridiculous.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Amy, there were Chinese food containers in the trash can."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Amy,Poor Leonard.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Sheldon and Amy listening at Penny’s door.,Amy,Do you hear anything?
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Sheldon and Amy listening at Penny’s door.,Sheldon,I hear a woman’s voice.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Sheldon and Amy listening at Penny’s door.,Amy,Is it Penny?
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Sheldon and Amy listening at Penny’s door.,Sheldon,"No, it’s you. All right, I hear whispering and giggling. Now I think I hear kissing."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Sheldon and Amy listening at Penny’s door.,Amy,"Yeah, like you know what kissing sounds like."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Sheldon and Amy listening at Penny’s door.,Sheldon,"There’s kissing in Star Trek, smarty-pants."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Sheldon and Amy listening at Penny’s door.,Amy,Let me listen. Sounds like Leonard.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Sheldon and Amy listening at Penny’s door.,Sheldon,"Please. Why would Leonard come home early and waste his time kissing Penny when he could be hanging out with his best buddy? Yeah, that’s it. I’m catching her in the act.(Unlocks door)"
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Sheldon and Amy listening at Penny’s door.,Amy,"No, Sheldon, don’t."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Sheldon and Amy listening at Penny’s door.,Sheldon,Aha.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Sheldon and Amy listening at Penny’s door.,Penny,What the hell?
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Sheldon and Amy listening at Penny’s door.,Sheldon,Leonard?
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Sheldon and Amy listening at Penny’s door.,Penny,"Sheldon, you cannot just barge in here like that."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Sheldon and Amy listening at Penny’s door.,Sheldon,"Right.(Goes out.) (Knock, knock, knock)Penny.(Knock, knock, knock)Penny.(Knock, knock, knock)Penny. Are you going to answer the door or should I open it and say aha again?"
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"I’m sorry, Sheldon. I should’ve told you I was back. I just wanted to have a couple days alone with Penny."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, no, I should apologize. Uh, I never realized to what extent our friendship was a burden to you."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,That is not fair. I complain about what a burden it is at least once a month.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, no, no, let’s not sugarcoat this. You find me finicky, pedantic and annoying."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"No, he doesn’t."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,I actually have used those exact words before. In that order.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, Leonard, I think it’s high time you and I address the tweepadock in the room."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,The what?
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,Amy?
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Amy,Please leave me out of this.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Fine. Leonard, there’s no need for you to pretend to like me anymore."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"Come on, I said I was sorry."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,"No, no, you save your apologies for after you’ve had disappointing coitus with Penny."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,It was fine.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"Come on, this is silly. Hey, um, I brought you back a little present from my trip, huh? It’s that sailor cap that you wanted. It’s neat, huh?"
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,You honestly think you can buy back my friendship with a cheap souvenir?
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"I don’t. I really don’t. Just try it on. Oh, yeah."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Amy,"Hello, sailor."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Ooh, now we’re talking."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Excuse me. This changes nothing. Except the Halloween costume I’m wearing this year. Amy, you’re going to be Olive Oyl. Lay off the doughnuts."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,Thanks for coming over.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,"No problem. Ooh, you made little sandwiches."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,"Yeah, that’s cucumber and cream cheese. That’s turkey and loganberry. And don’t tell my hips, but I’m warming up a brie in the oven."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,"Nice. So, mmm. What’s up?"
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,"Okay, well, I’ve been reading up on all the side effects you can get from oestrogen, and, I need you to be honest with me. Do my boobs look bigger to you?"
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,"Well, it’s kind of hard to tell."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,"Come on, Raj, it’s a yes or no question."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,"I’m not sure. Um, wait. Jump up and down, let’s see if they jiggle. Uh, no, I, I still can’t tell, uh, oh, you know what? Okay, uh, give me some of this."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,Seriously?
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,Do you want my help or not?
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,Fine.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,"Okay, yup. See, see, that, that looks like, that looks like they could be bigger. But you know, I bet, I bet when I do it, mine do the same thing."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,"Yeah, they kind of do."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,"Hmm. Uh, let me see something.(Grabs his boob)"
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,"Hey, easy, my nipples are sensitive."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,"Oh. Sorry, sorry, uh, okay.(Grabs boob again. Behind them, Bernadette walks in)I mean, yeah, maybe."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,"Okay, let me feel. No, I am definitely up a cup size."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,"You know, but, but they’re very firm, so you’ve got that going for you."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,You think?
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, very perky."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,"Thank you. I really needed to hear that today.(Bernadette rolls eyes and walks out)Ooh, brie’s ready."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,Yay.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Leonard,Good morning.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Sheldon,Hello.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Leonard,So am I driving you to work or are you still mad at me?
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Sheldon,I’d like a ride. Assuming you actually do take me to work.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Leonard,Where do you think I would take you?
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Who knows? Uh, you said you’d be home yesterday, but you came home three days ago. You say you’re taking me to work, but for all I know, I’ll end up in a deserted amusement park. Or a cornfield maze. Or a back alley dog fight. You tell me."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Leonard,I’m going to work. You can come if you want.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Okay. By the way, you have something on your shirt."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Leonard,"No, I don’t."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Hurts, doesn’t it? You know, I find myself wondering if anything you’ve ever told me is true."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Leonard,"I didn’t make it back. The ship sank, I’m in hell."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Sheldon,"You say you’re from New Jersey, but how can I believe you?"
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Leonard,Why would anyone claim to be from New Jersey if they weren’t?
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Sheldon,"All right, I’ll give you that one."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Leonard,"Hey, I said I was sorry. What else do you want from me?"
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Sheldon,I want you to admit that what you did was wrong.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Leonard,Fine. What I did was wrong.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Sheldon,I wish I could believe you.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Leonard,"You know what? I’m not driving you to work, because you’re incredibly annoying."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Sheldon,"You say one thing and do the other, so then you are driving me and you find me a delight."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Leonard,Stop it.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Sheldon,Keep it up?
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Leonard,Bye.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Sheldon,Hello. So I guess you’re really holding up the other four fingers?
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell.,Penny,"Oh, hey, what are you doing here so early?"
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell.,Amy,Driving Sheldon to work.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell.,Penny,"He’s still mad at Leonard, huh?"
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell.,Amy,"Well, he’s mad at you, too. He says you’re the succubus who led his friend astray."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell.,Penny,"I don’t know what succubus is, but it has suck in it, so that can’t be good."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell.,Sheldon,Thought I heard you out here.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell.,Penny,"Hey, Sheldon."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell.,Sheldon,You don’t get a hey. You get a hmm.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell.,Penny,"Come on, don’t be like that. We had so much fun together the last couple of months."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell.,Sheldon,You’re right. Which makes your betrayal all the more devastating.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell.,Penny,Sheldon.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell.,Sheldon,I let you buy feminine hygiene products with my supermarket club card. You have any idea the kind of coupons I’m going to get in the mail now?
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell.,Amy,"Sheldon, your fight’s with Leonard. Penny’s got nothing to do…"
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Careful, Amy. The friend of my enemy’s girlfriend is my enemy."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell.,Amy,Really?
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell.,Sheldon,Yes. You’re either with me or against me.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell.,Amy,You want to take the bus to work?
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell.,Sheldon,Maybe there’s a third option.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The stairwell.,Amy,"FYI, I had a doughnut for breakfast, you jerk."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"So now we’re just waiting for the data from the ship to be crunched, but the numbers look pretty promising."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The cafeteria.,Howard,"That’s so great. If you guys prove the existence of Unruh radiation… Hey, hey, hey, hey. My eyes are up here."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Howard, Raj. Judas."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The cafeteria.,Leonard,You know what? You’re a crazy person.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"A crazy person with a long memory, and if all goes according to plan, a robot army."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The cafeteria.,Howard,Stop it.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,Or a mutant army. It depends on how my Kickstarter goes.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The cafeteria.,Howard,"I said, stop it. Now, listen to me. You two aren’t just friends. You’re best friends. And that’s a beautiful thing. I mean, Leonard, you know why he’s so mad at you? It’s ’cause he missed you. Yeah, and as his friend, you should be happy he has love in his life. As I do. This man held my breast the other day and I love him for it."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The cafeteria.,Raj,"A little loud, dude."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The cafeteria.,Howard,"So, can we please put aside these petty differences and just be glad we’re here together?"
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The cafeteria.,Leonard,Okay.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,I suppose so.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The cafeteria.,Howard,Thank you.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The cafeteria.,Raj,"Uh, it wasn’t anything weird. It was just to see how big they were."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Sheldon,"And then Leonard took me to the barber and the dentist, and then to cap off the perfect day, the Los Angeles Bureau of Weights and Measures."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Leonard,"I thought the measures were going to be the stars of the show, turns out it was the weights."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Penny,I’m so glad you guys are friends again.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Sheldon,"And I’m glad you and I are friends again, too."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Penny,Aw.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Which reminds me. This came in the mail, and I want you to have it."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Penny,Fifty cents off Vagisil.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Sheldon,Think of me when you apply it.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Raj,"Uh, can I just say, I’ve missed all of us hanging out together."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Sheldon,Yeah.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Penny,"Me, too."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Leonard,"Um, since when can Koothrappali talk in front of the girls without a beer?"
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Bernadette,"Oh, that happened right after you left."
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Leonard,And no one told me?
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Howard(crying),Can’t believe we forgot to tell him.
Series 07,Episode 02,The Deception Verification,The apartment.,Penny(handing Howard the Vagisil coupon),Think of Sheldon when you apply it.
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,Raj,"So, couldn’t help but notice none of you RSVP’d to my murder mystery dinner party."
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,Leonard,"Oh, yeah. We were meaning to do that."
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,Raj,"No, you weren’t because it was a week ago and nobody came. So, if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed Koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference, it was all of you."
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,Sheldon,"I don’t think thatqualifies as a mystery, we all knew what we were doing."
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,Amy,"We’re sorry, Rajesh."
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,Bernadette,Maybe we can do it next week.
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,Howard,"Whoa, whoa, we’re not that sorry."
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,Raj,"Don’t worry, I can take a hint. No more murder mystery parties."
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,Leonard,Great.
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,Sheldon,Thank you.
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,Howard,Hallelujah.
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,Raj,Because I’ve got something even better planned.
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,Leonard,Aw.
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,Howard,Why?
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,Sheldon,Come on.
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,Raj,Just hear me out. I’m going to make you guys a scavenger hunt like they have at M.I.T.
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,Howard,"Oh, I loved those. I did them every year there."
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,Leonard,"We did them at Princeton, too."
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,Howard,"Oh, that’s cute. Like it’s a real college."
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,Sheldon,"That’s amusing, I was going to say that about M.I.T., but it works for Princeton, too."
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,Amy,"Scavenger hunts at Harvard were really tough. I always got stuck on the first challenge, trying to find someone to be on a team with me. I guess that story’s more sad than funny."
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,Penny,I love scavenger hunts. My friends and I had them all the time.
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,Leonard,"Oh, these are a little different. There’s a tradition at elite universities…"
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,Howard,And Princeton.
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,Leonard,"A tradition of hunts full of puzzles that rely on logic and obscure knowledge, science."
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,Penny,"Oh, in ours we would just run around town looking for a store that would sell us beer."
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,Raj,"So, uh, who’s in?"
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,Leonard,I think it sounds fun.
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,Amy,"Yeah, me, too."
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,Various,"I’m in, let’s do it."
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,Sheldon,I’m sorry. Are we really doing this or are we tricking Koothrappali again like with the dinner party?
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The Cheesecake Factory,,Credits sequence.
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The apartment.,Leonard,What’s all this?
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, everything I could possibly need to win the scavenger hunt."
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The apartment.,Leonard,You really think he’s gonna send us to a bowling alley?
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, if he does, do you know how filthy those rental balls are? They might as well stand on the corner and give away free rectal exams."
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The apartment.,Raj,"Okay, everybody. Who’s ready for a scavenger hunt?"

Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The apartment.,Sheldon,He is a born showman.
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The apartment.,Raj,Any questions?
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The apartment.,Howard,"Yes, to be fair, do people who went to Princeton get a head start?"
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The apartment.,Leonard,It’s not funny.
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The apartment.,Sheldon,"No, Oh, it actually is if you get the joke. It’s based on the premise that Princeton isn’t a very good school."
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The apartment.,Leonard,Ha-ha.
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, see? Now he gets it."
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The apartment.,Raj,"Okay, guys, go ahead and divide yourselves into teams of two."
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The apartment.,Bernadette,Should we just do couples?
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The apartment.,Leonard,Couples sounds great. Or we could mix things up. Maybe pick names out of a hat. Whatever.
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The apartment.,Penny,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why don’t you just admit you don’t want to be on a team with me."
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The apartment.,Leonard,"I just said, couples sound great."
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The apartment.,Penny,"Mm-hmm, yeah, you don’t think I’m smart enough. You think I’m gonna be a liability. Even though I totally just used the word liability correctly in a sentence. Yeah."
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The apartment.,Leonard,"All right, let’s, let’s do couples. I want to."
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The apartment.,Penny,"No, no. Let’s mix things up. I choose Sheldon, and we’re gonna kick your ass!"
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The apartment.,Sheldon,Really? The only time I’m ever picked first for a team and I’m stuck with the liability?
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The apartment.,Amy,Stop that. Penny is not a liability.
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The apartment.,Penny,Thank you. Do you want to be on my team?
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,The apartment.,Amy,Maybe we pick names out of a hat.
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,Penny’s apartment. (Montage with scenes in the apartment and Leonard’s bedroom),Penny,"All right, hurry up and close the door so they can’t hear us. Would you stop pouting? So, you picked my name. Get over it."

Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,"The Cheesecake Factory, karaoke night.",Howard,Cherry
Series 07,Episode 03,The Scavenger Vortex,"The Cheesecake Factory, karaoke night.",Together,"She got the way to groove me, yeah!"
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Sheldon,So what’d you think?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Amy,It was good.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Sheldon,That’s it? Good”
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Amy,"I enjoyed it. When you told me I was going to be losing my virginity, I didn’t think you meant showing me Raiders of the Lost Ark for the first time."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Sheldon,"My apologies. I chose my words poorly. I should have said you were about to have your world rocked on my couch. Anyway, thank you for watching it. It’s one of my all-time favourites."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Amy,It was very entertaining despite the glaring story problem.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Story problem? You, oh, Amy, what a dewy-eyed moon-calf you are. Raiders of the Lost Ark is the love child of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, two of the most gifted filmmakers of our generation. I’ve watched it 36 times, except for the snake scene and the face-melting scene, which I can only watch when it’s still light out, but, I defy you to find a story problem. Here’s my jaw, drop it."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Amy,"All right. Indiana Jones plays no role in the outcome of the story. If he weren’t in the film, it would turn out exactly the same."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, I see your confusion. You don’t understand. Indiana Jones was the one in the hat with the whip."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Amy,"No, I do, and if he weren’t in the movie, the Nazis would have still found the ark, taken it to the island, opened it up and all died, just like they did. Let me close that for ya."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,,Credits sequence.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The foyer.,Leonard,Hey.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The foyer.,Penny,Hi. I thought you went to the comic book store on Wednesdays.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The foyer.,Leonard,"Yeah, but Sheldon and Amy were having date night and they don’t need me there to make it awkward. They have each other for that. So, how was school?"
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The foyer.,Penny,"Oh, good. Check it out, The Disappointing Child by Beverly Hofstadter."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The foyer.,Leonard,You bought my mom’s book?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The foyer.,Penny,Yeah. It’s on the recommended reading list for my psychology class.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The foyer.,Leonard,"Oh, come on. Not that book. It, it’s got, like, every horrible story from my childhood in it."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The foyer.,Penny,"Oh, cool. Are there pictures?"
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The foyer.,Leonard,"Seriously, please find another book."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The foyer.,Penny,"Oh, come on. Why? How bad could it be?"
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The foyer.,Leonard,"There, there’s chapters about potty training, and bed-wetting and masturbation. Basically, if something came out of me, she wrote about it. You know what? Do whatever you want, just don’t talk to me about it."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The foyer.,Penny,Not even the chapter on the breast-feeding crisis?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The foyer.,Leonard,"It was not a crisis. Apparently, I favoured the left one, she got a little lopsided."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The foyer.,Penny,"Oh, my God, you still go left."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The cafeteria.,Raj,Which celebrity would you say I look like the most?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The cafeteria.,Howard,Halle Berry. Why?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The cafeteria.,Raj,"Stuart and I are putting dating profiles online, and it’s one of the questions. And thank you, I’d kill for that woman’s bone structure."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The cafeteria.,Leonard,Why are you reading Pride and Prejudice?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"I’ll tell you why. Amy ruined Raiders of the Lost Ark for me, so now I’m trying to find something beloved to her and ruin that."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The cafeteria.,,Because her life wasn’t enough?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The cafeteria.,Raj,"Wait, how can, how can anyone ruin Raiders? It’s perfect."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Yeah, except for the fact that Indiana Jones is completely irrelevant to the story. With or without him, the Nazis find the ark, open it and die."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The cafeteria.,All,Aw!
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The cafeteria.,Howard,"Hey, wait a minute. No, the Nazis were digging in the wrong place. The only reason they got the ark was because Indy found it first."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"Actually, they were only digging in the wrong place because Indy had the medallion. Without him, they would have had the medallion and dug in the right place."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The cafeteria.,All,Aw!
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Okay, I know you don’t want to talk about it, but can I just ask you one question about your mom’s book?"
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,No.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,I just want to know why a five-year-old boy puts on his mom’s make-up and wears balloon boobies.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"They weren’t boobies, they were muscles. And the make-up was green. I was pretending to be The Hulk."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,You were wearing her bra.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,That was to keep my muscles from sagging. Can we please stop talking about this?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Okay, okay. But you know, as a student of psychology who got a check-plus on her first homework assignment, I think, sometimes, it’s good to open up about these things."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"Okay, fine. Do you want to know why I dressed like The Hulk? Because I was always mad at my mom and I wanted to smash my way out of that house."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Well, why were you so angry?"
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"Gee, I don’t know. Maybe it’s because I was always the subject of her little experiments. Did you get to the chapter where she staged the Easter egg hunt with no eggs to see how long I’d keep looking? The answer, by the way, June."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Sweetie, I’m so sorry. I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"I do, too, but there’s not."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,Really? Are you sure about that?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"Of course, who am I to argue with a check-plus student? Just warning you, I’m gonna go right. Don’t make a big deal out of it."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Stuart,Is make-up really necessary?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Well, when someone looks at your dating profile, the first thing they see is your picture. I just want to make sure you look fun and full of life and not like a body they just pulled out of the river. All right, here we go, and smile. Okay, uh-uh, that one’s in the bank. How about this? Turn away, and then turn back into it. But when you do, imagine the camera is the girl you want to meet."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Stuart,You got it.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Okay, uh, let’s try it again. Uh, but this time, pretend the girl you want to meet doesn’t want to hurt you."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Stuart,I don’t think I can give you that.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Come on. One more time. Yeah, it’s, it’s a little blurry, but I think that works in your favour. Do you want a beer?"
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Stuart,"Sure. Hey, have you finished writing your profile yet?"
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Almost. Oh, what did you put as the one-word description of yourself?"
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Stuart,"I put unobjectionable. But now that I hear it out loud, it just seems like I’m being cocky. What did you put for your best feature?"
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"My parents’ money. Uh, what did you put for your best feature?"
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Stuart,I put: not applicable.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Come on, dude, you’re being too hard on yourself. You’ve got a lot of good stuff going on."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Stuart,Really? Like what?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Well, okay, you’re a, you’re a talented artist, you own your own business."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Stuart,Neither of those things have ever helped me meet a woman.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Okay, well, can we imply that you’re well-endowed?"
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Stuart,I do have one oddly long testicle.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Okay, now you’re talking like a winner!"
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Leonard,Whatcha doin’?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, it turns out Amy’s beloved Pride and Prejudice is a flawless masterpiece. He’s got too much pride, she’s got too much prejudice, it just works."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Leonard,So you’re looking to ruin something for her in the funny pages?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Sheldon,Amy has a fondness for the comic strip Marmaduke.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Leonard,Mm-hmm. And?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Sheldon,"And I think I’ve got it. Consider, a family possesses a dog that is so large and poorly disciplined, he causes nothing but problems. Why do they keep him?"
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Leonard,Maybe they fell in love with him as a puppy and didn’t know how big he was gonna be.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Of course. You know, why couldn’t she just like Ziggy? Yeah? That thing’s riddled with plot holes."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Leonard,"Sorry, buddy."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Ooh, I think she’s a fan of Garfield as well. Oh, darn it, now so am I."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Leonard,I’ll see you later. I gotta go watch a stupid football game with Penny.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Wait, hang on. You’ve spent time with Amy. Can you think of anything she’s fond of that has a bunch of flaws she hasn’t noticed?"
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Leonard,I gotta go.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,You ready to go?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Yep. Hey, and maybe this time you don’t try and talk sports with the guys."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,Some sports bar. It’s like they never even heard of Quidditch. Do we really have to go?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Oh, come on. Every time we’re about to hang out with my friends, you don’t want to. It’s like, It’s too loud, or the bathroom’s too dirty, or they put a chicken wing in my ear. I mean…"
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"Well, you’re, you’re right. Let’s just go."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Hey, what’s going on with you?"
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"Nothing, I’m fine."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"All right, hang on. is this still about your mom’s book?"
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,No. Not everything is about my mom.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"‘Cause if you’re still upset about that, we don’t have to go."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,Except this is totally about my mom.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,I’m so sorry. I never should have read that book. You know what? You want to just get dinner and watch the game here?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,That sounds nice. Yeah.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,Okay.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"Or, you know, we could get take-out and watch the Blu-ray extended version of The Hobbit movie with commentary track. On account of how sad I am about my mom."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Leonard’s lab.,Howard,"Leonard, you ready for lunch?"
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Leonard’s lab.,Leonard,One sec. Hey. Sorry.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Leonard’s lab.,Howard,"Hi, Penny."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Leonard’s lab.,Penny,"Hi. All right, sweetie. You hang in there today."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Leonard’s lab.,Leonard,"I’ll try, but I might be sad again tonight."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Leonard’s lab.,Penny,Okay.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Leonard’s lab.,Howard,Wow. Sex at work?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Leonard’s lab.,Leonard,Leave it alone. That’s my girlfriend.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Leonard’s lab.,Howard,Sorry.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Leonard’s lab.,Leonard,Who just had sex with me at work.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Leonard’s lab.,Howard,Damn. How’d you swing that?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Leonard’s lab.,Leonard,"Well, whenever I talk about how awful my mom was, Penny will do anything to make me feel better."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Leonard’s lab.,Howard,Seriously?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Leonard’s lab.,Leonard,"Look, I mean, I’m not proud of it, but it does work. I got her to watch a six-part documentary on Monty Python. Even I was bored, I just wanted to see if she’d make it to the end."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Leonard’s lab.,Howard,You sound kind of proud of it.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Leonard’s lab.,Leonard,"I am, I’m really proud."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Amy(on webcam),"Hello, Sheldon. Is everything okay?"
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Sheldon,Yes. Why?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Amy,"Well, the last time you made an unscheduled video-chat, there was a curly fry in your regular fries and you thought someone might be trying to slip you a mickey."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Sheldon,"April 13, a dark night, indeed."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Amy,So what can I do for you?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Sheldon,I’m calling to invite you to a spontaneous date night tomorrow evening.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Amy,Really?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Yes. You were kind enough to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark with me. So I’d like to return the favour by inviting you to watch an episode of your favourite childhood television series, Little House on the Prairie."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Amy,That sounds lovely. Why are you rubbing your hands together?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Um, I’m putting on lotion. Are you in or not?"
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Amy,Of course I’m in.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Excellent. Then I shall see you tomorrow. Good night, Dr. Fowler."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Amy,"Good night, Dr. Cooper."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Good night, indeed. What a rube. Why would I put on lotion when I have such soft hands?"
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,You were really quiet during dinner. Is everything okay?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,"Yeah. I guess I was just thinking about my mom, and how sad my childhood was."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,"Yeah, I bet it sucked. I’m gonna take a bath, you do the dishes."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,How about I take a bath with you and see what happens.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,"Here’s what’s gonna happen. I’m gonna take a bath, and you’re gonna do the dishes."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,That’s it? No compassion?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,"Aw, poor Howie. We good? I’m gonna take a bath."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,Bernie…
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,"God, what is going on with you?"
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,I’m sharing my pain.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,And I’m not buying it. Try again.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,I’m learning to be a man in a culture where it’s increasingly difficult to know how?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bermadette,Strike two.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,"I’m copying Leonard. When he does this to Penny, they have sex and watch Monty Python."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,Howard.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,"I know. It was dumb, I shouldn’t have done it. And it’s making me feel sad. So sad. You know, why don’t you take a bath? I’ll do the dishes."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Three, two, one."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Stuart,That’s it. Our dating profiles are live on the Internet.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Attention all shoppers, my business is open for business!"
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Stuart,"That’s right, ladies. For all you know, I’m confident and fun to be around."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Oh, cool, it tells you when someone’s reading your profile. Jenny309. I hope that’s not her weight."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Stuart,"If it is, I’ll take her. Ooh, I got one, too. The ladies are coming to us. Oh, man, if I’d started this years ago, I’d be divorced two or three times by now."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"What? Another one. You know, it, it’s weird. When they’re reading your profile, does it, does it make you feel exposed? Like they see you naked?"
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Stuart,"Well, they’re not running away screaming, so, no."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Amy,I love Little House. It made me want to live on a farm so much I tried to milk my cat. That tangy bowl of Cheerios was not worth the stitches.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, you sit back, relax and enjoy a beloved childhood memory. You see that cabin there? I read they were illegally squatting on Indian land. Yeah. Personally, I think what we did to the Native Americans was wrong, but this is your favourite show, not mine. Oh, look at little Laura Ingalls, eating that peanut butter sandwich. Peanut butter? Huh? That’s strange, since peanut butter wasn’t introduced until the early 1900s. If I knew this show was about time travel, I would have watched it much sooner."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Amy,You’re trying to get back at me for what I said about Raiders of the Lost Ark.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Sheldon,"That’s silly. Almost as silly as Dr. Baker having a telephone, since telephones only existed in large cities at that time. This is more like Little House on the Preposterous."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Amy,"Sheldon, we’re in a relationship. When you get angry, just tell me. You don’t need to seek revenge."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Are you sure? Every time my dad stayed out all night, my mom would put hamster poop in his chewing tobacco."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Amy,"Well, that’s not how we’re going to do it."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Fine. I’m mad at you. Not only did you ruin Raiders for me, you may have ruined the whole franchise. Except for the fourth one, which was bad before you got your mitts on it."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Amy,I shouldn’t have said it. I’m sorry.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Sheldon,Thank you.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Amy,Do you feel better?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Sheldon,Yes. But not as good as I’m going to when I tell you that your precious Garfield has no reason to hate Mondays. He’s a cat. He doesn’t have a job.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"Hey, I was just… what is happening?"
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Oh, just a little treat. I know you’ve been feeling really bad about your mom lately."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, oh, I have. So bad."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"And I wanted to make you feel better, so I planned something very special for you."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"Uh-huh, I can already feel it working."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Mrs Hofstadter(on webcam),"Hello, Leonard."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,Mom?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Mrs Hofstadter,I understand you have been whining about my parenting in order to emotionally manipulate your girlfriend.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,I… uh…
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,Bernadette told me everything. Now you don’t get the left or the right.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Mrs Hofstadter,Let’s discuss why you continue to involve me in your sex life.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, please, Mommy. No, Mommy."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Mrs Hofstadter,"When you were six years old, you walked in on me and your father naked. I was swatting his bottom with your brand new Ping Pong paddle."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,I didn’t dream that?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Mrs Hofstadter,How did that make you feel?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"Penny, come back. I’m sad for real now."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"In the last two hours, 162 women have read our profiles. How many of them have sent us messages?"
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Stuart,Combined?
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,Yes.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Stuart,Zero.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Dude, this is, this is brutal."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Stuart,I don’t think I’ve ever felt so rejected. And I had a rescue dog who ran back to the pound.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"This is the worst. If we’re gonna get shot down, we might as well just go to a bar and do it old school."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Stuart,And make them look us in the eye.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Yeah, anything is better than this."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,A bar.,Raj,Hello.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,A bar.,Girl,Not interested.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,A bar.,Raj,I was wrong. This is worse.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Howard,"Wait, wait, if it wasn’t for Indiana Jones, the ark would never have ended up at the warehouse."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Sheldon,That’s true. He collected and delivered the ark to the proper authorities for filing.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Raj,Like a hero.
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,All,Yeah!
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,Leonard,"Although, technically, Indy was supposed to take the ark to a museum to be studied. He couldn’t even get that done."
Series 07,Episode 04,The Raiders Minimization,The apartment.,All,Aw!
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The Cheesecake Factory,Penny,"Awkward silence, Sheldon on his phone, no touching. Somebody’s having date night."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The Cheesecake Factory,Amy,It’s actually steamier than it looks. Sheldon’s looking up the phallic symbolism of root vegetables in Renaissance paintings.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The Cheesecake Factory,Sheldon,"Oh, no, I got bored with that. I’m just browsing cuticle scissors on Amazon."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The Cheesecake Factory,Penny,How do you not tear off his clothes and take him right here on this table?
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The Cheesecake Factory,Sheldon,"If you do that, I’ll scream."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The Cheesecake Factory,Amy,"Sheldon, I have some exciting news to tell you."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The Cheesecake Factory,Sheldon,"That makes two of us. My new cuticle scissors will be here in one to two business days. Come on, one."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The Cheesecake Factory,Amy,I’ve been invited to consult on an experiment at your university for a few months. Isn’t that great? We could have lunch together. We could carpool.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The Cheesecake Factory,Sheldon,"You know, riding with Leonard has gotten a little tedious lately. The only car game he ever wants to play is the Quiet Game. And he’s terrible at it, I always win."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The Cheesecake Factory,Amy,"So, you’re okay with this?"
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The Cheesecake Factory,Sheldon,"Well, why wouldn’t I be?"
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The Cheesecake Factory,Amy,"Well, this project would have us working in close proximity to one another. And there’s the vulgar adage that one should not defecate where one eats."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The Cheesecake Factory,Sheldon,"My father used to say that all the time. That and, um, who does one have to orally gratify to get a drink around here? But what does that have to do with you working at the university?"
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The Cheesecake Factory,Amy,"Sheldon, don’t defecate where you eat means don’t have a romantic relationship in the workplace."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The Cheesecake Factory,Sheldon,Really?
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The Cheesecake Factory,Amy,Yes.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The Cheesecake Factory,Sheldon,"Huh. Yeah, I always took it literally. That’s why I have never once moved my bowels in this or any restaurant. Hmm."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The Cheesecake Factory,Amy,I’m relieved that you don’t have a problem with us working together.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The Cheesecake Factory,Sheldon,"Not as relieved as I’m about to be. It’s a brave new world, little lady."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The Cheesecake Factory,,Credits sequence.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Howard,Are you crazy? You don’t want your girlfriend at work with you. Hell Clam.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Sheldon,Why not? Hairy Fairy.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Raj,"I think it could be romantic. You know, my parents met at his place of work."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Leonard,Your father’s a gynaecologist.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Raj,"I know. What started as a pap smear turned into a date. Which turned into her working there, which turned into marriage, which then turned into hatred, which continues to this day. Two-Eyed Cyclops."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Howard,Would you please tell him this isn’t a good idea?
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Leonard,"No, no, I think it’ll be great. Maybe next time he gets conjunctivitis at work, she can hold his head and try to put the drops in his eyes. Giant baby."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Sheldon,That’s a Raging Ogre.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Leonard,"Yeah, I know."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Howard,"I’m just saying, I’d never want to work with Bernadette. Can you imagine seeing someone all day long and then you’re supposed to hang out with them after work, too?"
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Raj,Hold on. We do that all the time. You and I work together and play together.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Howard,"Yeah, I know, and it drove me into the arms of another woman. Bipolar Bear."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, I appreciate your concern, but I won’t be seeing any more of Amy than I already do. I assume we’ll deduct any extra time we spend together at work from our weekly quota."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Leonard,Please let me be there when you tell her that.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Sheldon,Why? So you can see the look on Amy’s face when she hears my top-notch idea?
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Leonard,"Please, oh, please, just let me be there."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,"So, Amy, what are you gonna be working on at Caltech?"
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Amy,I’m leading a study to see if deficiency of the monoamine oxidase enzyme leads to paralyzing fear in monkeys.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,"If they’re anything like humans, the answer’s yes."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Amy,"Wait, you’ve, you’ve done this experiment on humans?"
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,"You mean like death row inmates with nothing to lose? No, that would be unethical."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"You know, not a lot of people know this, but the monoamine oxidase enzyme was discovered by a woman, Mary Bernheim. That’s right, my phone is just as smart as you guys."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon(off),"(Knock, knock, knock)Amy, Bernadette, Penny.(Knock, knock, knock)Amy, Bernadette, Penny.(Knock, knock, knock)Amy, Bernadette, Penny."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,"He’s never gonna stop doing that, is he?"
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Amy,I don’t mind. I’m hoping to put his love of repetition to good use someday.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Hi. Um, I’ve reconsidered. Uh, you can’t work where I work. Enjoy the rest of your evening."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Amy,Sheldon. I already signed the contract. I cashed a cheque.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Mmm, you are not going to come out of this looking good."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Sheldon, I don’t understand. I thought you said you were fine with it."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, I was. But that was before Howard explained to me how awful it would be if he had to work with his significant other."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,He said what?
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Now, don’t be insulted. He just thinks too much of you would be mind-numbingly tedious."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,"Excuse me, I need to have a chat with my husband."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Yeah, well, now, well, keep it short. From what I gather, brevity is your friend. So, are we good here?"
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Amy,"No, we’re not good here. I am working on this project."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Yeah, and you can’t tell her what she can and cannot do."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Last week, you told Leonard he couldn’t wear his Wookie jacket out in public."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,That’s different. I’m not going to the mall with someone dressed like a dumb space bear.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Amy,"Sheldon, you don’t have to worry about me bothering you. I’ll be in a different building. And we don’t even have to have lunch together."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,Really?
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Amy,"Yes. Before all things, I’m a scientist. I’m just there to do my work and, with a little luck, scare the living crap out of some monkeys."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,Hmm. You sure your mothlike personality won’t be drawn to this blazing fire that is myself?
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Amy,More and more sure.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, then, you have my permission."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Amy,I didn’t ask for your permission.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,Too late. No backsies.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Howard,"No, no, listen to me. Sheldon misunderstood. What I meant was, if we worked together, there’d be too much of me for you, not the other way around."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Howard, if you’re going to lie to your wife, don’t start the sentence with Sheldon misunderstood. That’s a dead giveaway."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,Well?
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Howard,"Okay, fine. I did say that, and I think it’s true. I think if we worked together and lived together, we’d get sick of each other."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Yeah, but to be fair, he only said the part about him getting sick of you."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Howard,"For the love of God, why?"
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,What exactly do you think you’d get sick of?
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Raj,His only options here are to fake a heart attack or have a real one.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Howard,It’s nothing in particular. I…
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,Is it my voice? Am I too bossy? What?
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Howard,My arm is feeling numb.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,Nailed it.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,"That’s the wrong arm for a heart attack, doofus."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Howard,"My point is, I’m sure there are things about me that would drive you crazy if you had to deal with them all day long."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,Like looking me in the eye and lying to me?
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Howard,"Oh, well, come on, where am I supposed to look when I lie to you?"
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,Find somewhere else to sleep tonight.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Howard,Bernie…
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,"If it makes you feel any better, Amy and I are fine. I mean, really good."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"So, boys, how was the pyjama party? You guys jump on the bed and sing into hair brushes?"
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The cafeteria.,Raj,"It wasn’t a pyjama party. It was just a couple of bros hanging out, giggling, eating cookie dough and watching Princess Bride."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The cafeteria.,Howard,"Please, stop talking."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The cafeteria.,Raj,As you wish.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The cafeteria.,Howard,"I mean, you know, Sheldon, none of this would’ve happened if I hadn’t tried to help you."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Uh, it also wouldn’t have happened if, in the early universe, hydrogen was a little more common or a little less common. This is fun. Your turn."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The cafeteria.,Amy,Gentlemen.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The cafeteria.,Raj,Amy.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The cafeteria.,Leonard,Hey.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,Hello.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The cafeteria.,Leonard,That was kind of icy. You two okay?
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Oh, we’re fine. As Howard advised, she’s merely respecting our professional boundaries."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The cafeteria.,Leonard,Smart. Take relationship advice from a man who spent last night braiding Raj’s hair.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Yeah, you make a good point. It would appear I was worried for nothing. Look at her, desperately wishing she was over here at the cool table. Don’t worry, little moth. The flame will come to you."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The cafeteria.,Raj,"Oh, uh, on the off chance that Bernadette doesn’t call back and apologize, how do you feel about Mexican food for dinner tonight?"
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The cafeteria.,Howard,I don’t know. Sounds kind of heavy.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The cafeteria.,Raj,That’s ’cause you always fill up on chips.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The cafeteria.,Amy,And this is Dr. Gunderson from Stockholm.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Ah, Sweden. Yeah, home of my favourite Muppet and, uh, second favourite meatball. Okay, the Nordic reputation for lack of humour is well-founded. Boy, is his name Gunderson or No-Funderson?"
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The cafeteria.,Amy,"Where are we going with this, Dr. Cooper?"
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Oh, please, I’m your boyfriend. You call me Sheldon. That’s right, I am in a boy-girl relationship with this cute little lump of wool."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The cafeteria.,Amy,Sheldon.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"It’s a physical relationship, too. Hand-holding, hugging, even on hot days. Ow. Okay, here’s a new one. Apparently now we kick each other in the shin under the table. How do you like it when I do it to you? Not so much, huh?"
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s lab.,Amy,"Test subject D7, aka Betsy, fear response study. Image number one, Frenchman on bicycle carrying baguettes. No visible reaction. Image number two, sousaphone. Still no reaction. Okay. Let’s kick things up a notch. Image number three, crocodile with a mouthful of monkeys. Okay, now we’re talking."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,Dr. Fowler?
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s lab.,Amy,"What do you want, Sheldon?"
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,"Well, I’m done with work, so… ugh!"
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s lab.,Amy,"Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry, uh, better?"
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,"Oh, baguettes. Yes, I like baguettes. What exactly are you doing?"
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s lab.,Amy,Determining baseline fear levels in capuchin monkeys by measuring their response to visual stimuli.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,"So, goofing off. As I was saying, I’m done with work and Leonard’s not. So good news, you get to take me home. Play your cards right, I’ll let you drive me past the lot where the buses park at night."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s lab.,Amy,"I can’t leave now, Sheldon. I’m very busy. Besides, why would I want to do you a favour after the way you treated me in the cafeteria? Image number four, boa constrictor."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,What on earth are you talking about? My behaviour in the cafeteria was delightful. Maybe your friend Gunderson needs to head over to IKEA and assemble a sense of humour.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s lab.,Amy,"You embarrassed me in front of my colleagues on my first day here. Image number five, kitten in a teacup."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,Aw. Embarrassed you?
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s lab.,Amy,You know what? I don’t have time for this. Find another way home.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,I’m starting to get the sense that you’re angry with me.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s lab.,Amy,Really? What tipped you off?
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,"Couple things, actually. Your tone of voice, your body language…"
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s lab.,Amy,Get out.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,"Well, now, that."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s lab.,Amy,"Image number six, woman giving birth."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,Bleugh!
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Leonard,"It’s nine o’clock, where you been?"
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, I had to take the bus home. Fell asleep and missed my stop."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Penny,"Oh, no."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Sheldon,Did you know that Los Angeles has a Little Sri Lanka?
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Leonard,I did not.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, I do now. They’re a lovely people. Although terrifying when you wake up face-to-face with them. If you’re hungry, I brought home some mutton and coconut milk."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Penny,Why’d you get that? You hate lamb.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Sheldon,"I was asking for directions. Apparently, there was a communication problem."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Leonard,I thought Amy was gonna drive you home.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Yeah, I thought so, too, but she’s acting very strangely. I was discussing it with a Sri Lankan fellow on the bus, and he hypothesized that a tiger may have recently run across her shadow. Although he may have just been trying to drum up business for his brother-in-law’s witch doctor practice."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Penny,"Okay, Sheldon, what happened between you and Amy?"
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, can you believe she said I embarrassed her?"
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Penny,Yeah.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Sheldon,But you didn’t even hear the details.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Leonard,"Sheldon, I’ve known you a long time, and I’m going to tell you this with all the love I can possibly muster. Amy’s right. You’re wrong."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Sheldon,But you don’t even know…
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Leonard,Doesn’t matter.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Sheldon,"But, now, but in my defence…"
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Leonard,Doesn’t matter.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Sheldon,You’re not listening to my side of it.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Penny,"Okay, fine, Sheldon. What is your side?"
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Sheldon,Well…
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Penny,"Nope, got to go with Amy on this one."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,"Ooh, shrimp was spicy."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,You want a TUMS?
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,You got the tropical fruit kind?
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"No, if I buy those, I just go through them like candy."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,"Tell me about it. One time, I swear I pooped out a stick of chalk.(Knock on door)I’ll get it."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,Thanks.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Raj’s apartment.,Bernadette,Hi.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,"Oh, hi."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Raj’s apartment.,Bernadette,I may have overreacted.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,"Yeah, well, I didn’t handle it so great, either."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Raj’s apartment.,Bernadette,It’s just sometimes I feel like you enjoy spending time with your friends more than with me.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,That’s not true.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Raj’s apartment.,Bernadette,"It’s not? You spend all day together at work, and then you all hang out at night playing games, going to the comic book store. Last week, you two got a couples massage. So, when you said you wouldn’t want to spend that much time with me, it really hurt my feelings."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,"Oh, wow. Yeah, no, I get that. I’m so sorry. Starting tomorrow, I am turning over a new leaf. Time with you is my number one priority."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Raj’s apartment.,Bernadette,Why tomorrow?
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,"Well, we’re real close to finishing off the new Batman game."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"It is awesome. Uh, you should probably go after her."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,Should I go after you?
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Raj’s apartment.,Bernadette(off),No!
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,Thanks for getting me in trouble.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock)Amy.(Knock, knock, knock)Amy.(Knock, knock, knock)Amy."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Sheldon, what are you doing here so late?"
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"I couldn’t sleep because I kept thinking about what happened earlier between us. Also, I had one heck of a bus nap. Oh, speaking of which, do you want some mutton and coconut milk?"
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s apartment.,Amy,No.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, I cannot give this stuff away."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s apartment.,Amy,What do you want?
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Amy, this isn’t easy to say. All relationships are difficult, but even more so when you’re in one with a person who struggles with everyday social interactions. And frankly, who can strike some people as being kind of a weirdo."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Sheldon, you’re not a weirdo."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"I wasn’t speaking about me. I mean, honestly, there’s no telling what will set you off. You know, introducing myself as your boyfriend. Giving you the opportunity to drive me home. Breaking the ice with your colleagues using ethnic humour, the funniest kind of humour."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s apartment.,Amy,What’s your point?
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"My point is, we’re a couple, and I like you for who you are, quirks and all."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"I like you, too."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, I should hope so. I don’t see anyone else banging on this door to put up with your nonsense. Not even a good-bye? You see, that’s the kind of thing that makes people think you’re weird. Poor kid. She just doesn’t see it."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The Cheesecake Factory Bar.,Bernadette,I’m not apologizing to Howard. He can come beg me on his knees.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The Cheesecake Factory Bar.,Amy,"Sheldon, too. If I see him at work, I’m just going to ignore him."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The Cheesecake Factory Bar.,Penny,"All right, don’t worry. I talked to Leonard. He is gonna sit the guys down and set them straight."
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Leonard,Laser’s warmed up.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,Howard,Pull.
Series 07,Episode 05,The Workplace Proximity,The apartment.,All,Yeah!
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The Cheesecake Factory,Penny,What are you working on?
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The Cheesecake Factory,Sheldon,Can’t talk. In the zone.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The Cheesecake Factory,Penny,Do you know what he’s doing?
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The Cheesecake Factory,Amy,"Could be anything. Last time he was like this, he figured out electron transport in graphene. The time before that, he was making a list of who’s allowed in his tree fort if fe ever gets one. Still can’t believe I didn’t make the cut."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The Cheesecake Factory,Penny,"Uh, Sheldon, you want to take a break? Your food’s ready."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The Cheesecake Factory,Leonard,"No, no, what are you doing? He’s both happy and quiet. It’s like seeing a unicorn and Bigfoot at the same time."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The Cheesecake Factory,Howard,Sorry we’re so late. Bernadette got stuck at work.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The Cheesecake Factory,Bernadette,Great news. A raccoon virus just crossed the species barrier and now can infect humans.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The Cheesecake Factory,Raj,Why is that great news?
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The Cheesecake Factory,Bernadette,"In the pharmaceutical business we have a saying, mo’ infections, mo’ money."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The Cheesecake Factory,Howard,"Wait, Maybe you want to wash your little raccoon hands first."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The Cheesecake Factory,Bernadette,"Oh, calm down. If I had it, I’d be dead already."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The Cheesecake Factory,Howard,"Guys, listen up."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The Cheesecake Factory,Sheldon,"Can’t listen, zone. Also don’t care."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The Cheesecake Factory,Howard,Next week is the anniversary of my first date with Bernadette.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The Cheesecake Factory,Sheldon,Really don’t care.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The Cheesecake Factory,Howard,"I want to do something special, and I was hoping you guys could be a part of it."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The Cheesecake Factory,Penny,"Aw, what horrible thing are you trying to make up for?"
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The Cheesecake Factory,Howard,Just putting something in the bank for what horrible thing I do next.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The Cheesecake Factory,Penny,Ah.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The Cheesecake Factory,Howard,"Look, she’s gonna be back any second, so here’s the deal. I’m writing a song, and I was hoping we could all play it for her together."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The Cheesecake Factory,Leonard,Aw.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The Cheesecake Factory,Amy,"Oh, I love that."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The Cheesecake Factory,Raj,That is so beautiful.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The Cheesecake Factory,Howard,Sheldon?
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The Cheesecake Factory,Sheldon,When did we get to the Cheesecake Factory?
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The Cheesecake Factory,,Credits sequence
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The stairwell,Leonard,It’s really sweet what Howard wants to do for Bernadette.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The stairwell,Penny,"Yeah. Hey, how come you’ve never done anything romantic to celebrate our first date?"
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The stairwell,Leonard,"Well, for starters, you’ve broken up with me so many times, which first date are we talking about?"
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The stairwell,Sheldon,"Ooh, somebody call the burn ward. And back to the zone."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The stairwell,Leonard,"And besides, I do romantic things for you all the time. Can you even name one romantic thing you’ve done for me?"
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The stairwell,Penny,I can name tons.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The stairwell,Leonard,Sex doesn’t count.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The stairwell,Penny,"Oh. I know, what about that bed-and-breakfast?"
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The stairwell,Leonard,"Well, I took you there. All you did was…"
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The stairwell,Penny,"I know what I did. I bet they had to throw out that rocking chair. You know, I can be romantic if I want to."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The stairwell,Leonard,It’s fine. And also not true.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The stairwell,Penny,"Okay, just you wait and see. I’m gonna romance your freakin’ ass off."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The stairwell,Leonard,That’s beautiful. Is that Shakespeare?
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The stairwell,Penny,Sheldon?
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The stairwell,Sheldon,Zone.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The stairwell,Leonard,He’ll figure it out when he falls off the roof.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Leonard,"Sheldon, I know you’re in the zone, but do you want some tea? All right, I can’t believe I’m gonna say this, but you haven’t spoken in hours and I’m starting to get worried. Please say something."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Leonard, prepare to be humbled and weep at the glory of my genius."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Leonard,"Nope, it was better before."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Look at it. I feel like my mind just made a baby. And it’s beautiful. It’s not like human babies, which are loud and covered in goop."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Leonard,"Holy crap, Sheldon, did you just figure out a method for synthesizing a new stable super-heavy element?"
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Did I? Well, that can’t be right. No one’s ever done that before. Except me, because I just did it. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain…"
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Leonard,"Yeah, definitely better before."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Howard,So I’m almost done writing the song for Bernadette. Are you cool playing the cello?
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"If by cool you mean willing to, yes. If by cool you mean cool, clearly you’ve never seen me play the cello."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Howard,Great. Will you play the ukulele?
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Raj,Of course. I’d be happy to shred it on my ax.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Howard,"Or you could just play your tiny, ridiculous guitar."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Raj,Fine. I will melt her heart. And her face.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Gentlemen. Uh, no doubt you heard about my little breakthrough. Now, if your plan is to hoist me on your shoulders and carry me around the cafeteria, please refrain. I don’t care for heights, motion sickness or the thought of your necks touching my buttocks."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Howard,"Seriously, congratulations, Sheldon."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Raj,"Yeah, I read your paper online. That technique for creating a new heavy element is inspired."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Oh, well, thank you. Believe it or not, I just learned a Chinese research team at the Hubei Institute for Nuclear Physics ran a test on a cyclotron, and the results were extremely promising."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"Sheldon, that’s incredible."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Yeah, I know. They called it the greatest thing since the Communist party. Although I’m pretty sure that the Communist party made them say that. I like China. See, they know how to keep people in line."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Howard,"So, what happens next?"
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Oh, more testing, more success, more fame. Yeah, but don’t worry, I will remain the same down-to-earth humble Joe I’ve always been."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Leonard,Good to know.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Now give me that cookie, I discovered an element."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,Thank you so much for coming.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Penny’s apartment.,Raj,You called the right person. I believe I have the perfect romantic evening for you to give Leonard.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Okay, good, ’cause I’ve been really struggling with this."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Penny’s apartment.,Raj,"As I’m sure you’re aware, the quickest way to a man’s heart is through his…"
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Pants, but Leonard says sex doesn’t count."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Penny’s apartment.,Raj,"Oh. You poor thing. You have one arrow in your quiver, and you just can’t use it. Fortunately, another pathway to a man’s heart is through his stomach."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"I don’t know if I want to cook for him. He’s kind of a picky eater. I mean, it’s too salty, it’s too dry, it’s too burnt and frozen at the same time. Okay, come on, what else would sweep you off your feet?"
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Penny’s apartment.,Raj,"Well, I’ve always had this fantasy that involves dancing. The sexual chemistry between my partner and me is electric. But boy, oh, boy, does my father not approve until he sees us in the big dance competition."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Okay, that’s just the plot for Dirty Dancing. What else would you love? Other than being lifted over Patrick Swayze’s head."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Penny’s apartment.,Raj,"Oh, oh, uh, you could, uh, stand outside his window with a boom box in the air."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,That’s from Say Anything.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Penny’s apartment.,Raj,"Look, I’m a lonely guy, I watch a lot of movies. Look, Penny, if you truly want to be romantic, it needs to come from you."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"I get that, but why is this so hard?"
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Penny’s apartment.,Raj,"Well, you’ve probably never had to do this stuff ’cause you’re young and beautiful and men have always thrown themselves at you."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Yeah, I’m trying to be sad about that. I can’t."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Let’s see, what’s next? Okay, here. This is the Magic Marker I was using when I made the discovery."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Amy,I don’t think the Smithsonian’s gonna want your marker.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Sheldon,"And that’s why you’re not on a list for my tree fort. Ooh, guess who’s getting an article written about him in Physics Today? I’ll give you a hint. You measured the diameter of his suspicious mole yesterday."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Amy,"Sheldon, I’m so proud of you."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, you should be. My discovery is spreading like wildfire. Unlike my mole, which is holding steady at the size of a navy bean."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Amy,What’s next?
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Sheldon,This is the very copy of The Handbook of Chemistry and Physics in which I looked up the reaction rates of mendelevium and…
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Amy,And what?
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Sheldon,"No. No, no, no, no."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Amy,What’s wrong?
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Sheldon,I’ve made a horrible mistake.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Amy,What are you talking about?
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Sheldon,"This table, it’s in square centimetres. I read it as square metres. You know what that means?"
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Amy,That Americans can’t handle the metric system?
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Amy,But the Chinese team found the element.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Yeah, well, they shouldn’t have. My calculations were wrong. There must be some resonance between the elements I didn’t know about."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Amy,So you just got lucky?
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Sheldon,Sheldon Cooper does not get lucky.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Amy,"You and me both, brother. It doesn’t matter. The element was found because of you, and that’s groundbreaking."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Sheldon,"What matters is the greatest scientific achievement of my life is based on a blunder. I’m not a genius, I’m a fraud."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Amy,"You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience, we’re forever finding something in one part of the brain that we thought was someplace else."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, great. Now I’m worse than a fraud. I’m practically a biologist."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Leonard’s car.,Leonard,": You got to stop beating yourself up over this. I mean, you made a mistake, but it was a happy mistake."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Leonard’s car.,Sheldon,There’s nothing happy about it. I’m being given credit that I don’t deserve.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Leonard’s car.,Leonard,"Oh, people get things they don’t deserve all the time. Look at me with you."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Leonard’s car.,Sheldon,"No, Leonard, this is going to haunt me for the rest of my life. Every science classroom, every periodic table, every textbook, this mistake will be staring back at me. Like that time you let Koothrappali wax your eyebrows. I’ve got to find a way to stop this thing."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Leonard’s car.,Leonard,"Buddy, I don’t think you can. I mean, once it’s out there, it’s out there. This thing is like the science equivalent of a sex tape."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Leonard’s car.,Sheldon,"You know, frankly, I’d prefer a sex tape."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Leonard’s car.,Leonard,"You don’t know what a sex tape is, do you?"
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Leonard’s car.,Sheldon,No.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Howard,Make sure you guys get to the restaurant by eight. Bernadette’s meeting me there at eight thirty and I don’t want to blow the surprise.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Leonard,We’ll be there.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Raj,"Got it. Now, uh, I have a question about the song. I was thinking at some point I could bust out a little rap."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Howard,E-Ni-Ni-Ni-Ni-No.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Raj,"Come on, come on, you haven’t even heard it yet. Leonard, give me a beat."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Leonard,I will not.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Raj,"Oh, please?"
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Howard,"No, I want this to be romantic."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Raj,"It will be. I don’t call anyone a ho, and the only time I use the phrase my bitch, I’m referring to you."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Voice,There he is.(General applause)
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,Stop it. Stop celebrating me.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Voice,Woo!
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"And no woos. Oh, not you, Dr. Woo. You’re fine. I want you all to know that you have no reason to applaud me. My so-called breakthrough wasn’t the result of my genius. It was nothing more than a boneheaded mistake. So please refrain from praising me for it in the future."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Raj,"Wait, I don’t understand. They didn’t find the element?"
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Oh, no, they found the element.(More applause)No, no, stop it. I don’t need to take this admiration from the likes of you people. How do I make them stop loving me?"
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The cafeteria.,Leonard,Invite them to live with us.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,A restaurant.,Penny,"Boy, Bernadette is gonna love this."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,A restaurant.,Leonard,Yeah. It must be nice to have someone do something so romantic.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,A restaurant.,Penny,"Okay, you know what’s not romantic? Rubbing it in someone’s face."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,A restaurant.,Leonard,"Actually, it can be, but I told you sex doesn’t count."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,A restaurant.,Howard,I’m getting worried about Bernadette. I’m gonna call and check on her.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,A restaurant.,Sheldon,The National Science Foundation wants to give me a substantial grant.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,A restaurant.,Raj,"Oh, that’s a big deal."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,A restaurant.,Sheldon,I know. When will this nightmare end?
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,A restaurant.,Leonard,"Hey, I get that you feel bad about all the attention, but still, what you did is amazing. We’re really proud of you."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,A restaurant.,Amy,I’m not.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,A restaurant.,Sheldon,You’re not?
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,A restaurant.,Amy,"Sheldon, I’ve been thinking about it, and you’re right. You don’t deserve any credit. All you did was misread some numbers on a table. A very easy table, too. Honestly, I’m embarrassed for you."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,A restaurant.,Sheldon,That’s the most romantic thing I’ve ever heard.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,A restaurant.,Penny,"Damn it, everyone’s better at this than me."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,A restaurant.,Sheldon,"Congratulations, Dr. Fowler. You just made the fort."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,A restaurant.,Howard,"Guys, there was an accident at Bernie’s lab."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,A restaurant.,Leonard,"Oh, my God, is she okay?"
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,A restaurant.,Howard,"Yeah, but she’s at the hospital in quarantine."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,A restaurant.,Penny,What?
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,A restaurant.,Amy,Poor Bernadette.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,A restaurant.,Leonard,"Oh, no."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,A restaurant.,Sheldon,"I hate to pile on the bad news, but I just got a raise."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The hospital.,Howard,"Oh, my God, Bernie, what happened?"
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The hospital.,Bernadette,"Well, let’s just say the next time you move a dozen vials of raccoon virus to the fridge, make two trips."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The hospital.,Howard,You’re sure you’re okay?
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The hospital.,Bernadette,"Yeah, it’s just a precaution. If there was a problem, I’d be throwing up out of my eyeballs by now. Sorry I messed up our date."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The hospital.,Howard,"Oh, don’t worry about it. I brought the date here. Guys, come on in."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The hospital.,Bernadette,What’s all this?
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The hospital.,Howard,"Well, tonight is the anniversary of our first date, and I wanted to celebrate it by writing a song for you."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The hospital.,Bernadette,Howie.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The hospital.,Amy,"Sheldon, get over here."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The hospital.,Sheldon,She might be contagious. Don’t you think I’m having a rough enough day?
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The hospital.,Amy,Sheldon.

Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The hospital.,Sheldon,"Is it me, or does she not look so good?"
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The hospital.,Amy,Shh.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The hospital.,Howard,"A candle without a wick, a Watson without a Crick, I’d be one of my outfits without a dick-ie. I’d be cheese without the mac, Jobs without the Wozniak, I’d be solving exponential equations that use bases not found on your calculator making it much harder to crack. I’d be an atom without a bomb, a dot without the com, and I’d probably still live with my mom."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The hospital.,All,And he’d probably still live with his mom.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The hospital.,Howard,"Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You supported all my dreams and all my hopes. You’re like uranium-235 and I’m uranium-238, almost inseparable isotopes. I couldn’t have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that I met you Bernadette."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The hospital.,Bernadette,"Oh, Howie."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The hospital.,Howard,"If I didn’t have you life would be dreary, I’d be string theory without any string. I’d be binary code without a one, a cathode ray tube without an electron gun. I’d be Firefly, Buffy and Avengers without Joss Whedon. I’d speak a lot more Klingon, Heghlu’meH QaQ jajvam."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The hospital.,All,And he’d definitely still live with his mom.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The hospital.,Howard,"Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You’re my best friend and my lover.

Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,It’s a first edition of Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. I remember it was your favourite book growing up.

Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,No. Something’s going on. What’s wrong with it? I remember you saying how great it would be to have a first edition.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"It’s true, I did. I did say that. When we were at the used bookstore together and I saw the first edition and I bought it."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Oh, my God, I am the worst."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"No, no, it’s okay. It’s really thoughtful."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"No, it’s not. I mean, what’s thoughtful is everything you do. Here, you know what? Look at this. Look, here’s the, the plane ticket you bought me when I was too poor to go home for the holidays. And the rose you left on my windshield just because. Here’s the, the thank-you letter you wrote me after the first time I slept with you. All 11 pages of it."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,I can’t believe you saved all this stuff.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,Of course I did. It’s you.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,Come here.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,Oh.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,Is that a pregnancy test?
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Oh, yeah, just the first one. I didn’t save them all."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Sheldon,I can’t believe I read this table wrong. I blame you.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Amy,Me? What did I do?
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Sheldon,You distract me. I’ve been distracted since the moment I met you.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Amy,Sorry.
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, you should be. Because all I can think about is how much I want to kiss you. And not just on the cheek, but on the mouth. Like mommies and daddies do."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Amy,"Oh, Sheldon."
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,"Sheldon(not in Amy’s daydream, now in the Cheesecake Factory)",Amy? Amy? Did you hear what I said?
Series 07,Episode 06,The Romance Resonance,The apartment.,Amy,"Can’t talk, in the zone."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Amy,I’ve never seen him this happy before.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Leonard,That’s because you’ve never seen him on restock the medicine cabinet day.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Sheldon,Look. A new topical antihistamine with lidocaine. Wow. I can’t wait until I get a rash.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Leonard,"Oh, Gas-X has a new ultra strength. I guess they really do read their mail."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Sheldon,"Hey, isn’t that Professor Proton?"
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Leonard,"Oh, yeah."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Sheldon,"Look at him, just standing in line like he wasn’t moderately famous 30 years ago. Let’s go say hello."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Leonard,"Oh, maybe we shouldn’t bother him."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Sheldon,"I’m not going to bother him, I’m going to talk to him."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Leonard,He thinks there’s a difference.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Sheldon,"Arthur? Arthur, it’s me, Sheldon Cooper. You may not remember because of your advanced age."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Arthur,"Trust me, I, I remember."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Sheldon,"This is my girlfriend, Amy. Amy, this is television legend Arthur Jeffries. His science show inspired millions of children."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Arthur,"Hold, hold, hold on. You, you have a girlfriend?"
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Amy,"Yes, and I’ve heard so much about you. Hey look, we’re wearing the same orthopaedic shoes. I can’t believe I dress like a celebrity."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Arthur,"Oh, okay, I get it now."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Leonard,"Dr. Jeffries, hello again. Leonard Hofstadter."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Arthur,"Oh, oh, right, I remember your, your girlfriend. Is, is she, is she here?"
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Leonard,"No, she’s not."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Sheldon,"So, what prescription are you getting filled?"
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Leonard,Sheldon.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Sheldon,"No. Wait, I want to guess. Don’t tell me."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Arthur,I wasn’t going to tell you.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Amy,"Sheldon, come on."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Sheldon,"No, no, no. I’m really good at this. All right, give me a hint. Does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything?"
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Arthur,"Well, given my age, that’s more than just a lucky guess."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon, let’s go mock the people buying homeopathic medicine, you love that."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Sheldon,"But I’m hanging out with my friend, and we’re having fun. Look how happy he is."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,,Credits sequence.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,,The cafeteria.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Howard,Bernie’s having a girls’ night on Friday at our place. You want to do something?
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Raj,"Actually, I’m busy."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Howard,Doing what?
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Raj,There’s a new sports bar over on Colorado Ave…
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Howard,You’re going to girls’ night.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Raj,Yeah.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Howard,You know they’re making jewellery right?
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Raj,You think they came up with that? They were going to drink beer and play darts.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Leonard,What’s up?
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Howard,Not his testosterone levels.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Raj,Excuse me. I happen to be very comfortable with my masculinity.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Howard,How is that possible?
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Leonard,"Hey, I got an email from Professor Proton."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Sheldon,Goody. What’s it say?
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Leonard,"He’s working on a paper about nano vacuum tubes, and wants to know if I’d take a look at it."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Sheldon,"That’s strange. That he would come to you for that and not me. Oh, I got two emails from him. Do you have Leonard’s email address? And. Never mind, I found it. I can’t believe he picked you over me."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Howard,You don’t want to read a paper by some old has-been who hasn’t done any real science in decades.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Raj,"Yeah, it’s nothing to cry about."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Sheldon,Sheldon Cooper does not cry.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,A supermarket,Howard,"It’s true, you’d rust."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Sheldon,And to think I idolized that man. And why? At the end of the day he’s just another Hollywood phony.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Amy,Is it really worth getting upset about?
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Yeah, they say don’t meet your heroes. Don’t peek behind that curtain of fame and celebrity, because if you do, you’ll see them as they really are, degenerate carnival folk."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Amy,"Come on, he’s a retired kids show host."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Sheldon,That’s even worse. Using the sweet candy of science to trick children into loving him. Pervert.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Amy,Have you ever thought about why Arthur didn’t want you to read his paper?
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Yes, I have. And my only conclusion is the prescription he was picking up the other day was for cuckoo pills."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Amy,"Maybe he found you, um, a bit much."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Sheldon,"That’s kind of a stretch. Look, when it comes to social skills, I’ve mastered the big three. There’s the coy smile. There’s the friendly chuckle. There’s the vocalization of sympathy. Aw. That last one’s tricky, I’m still working on it."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Amy,"From what I saw the other day, I could understand why he and some people might find you…"
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Sheldon,What?
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Amy,Doesn’t matter.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Sheldon,"No, go ahead, say it. I know what it is. I’ve heard it my whole life. The word’s annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say I’m annoying."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Amy,Sheldon.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, it won’t hurt my feelings. Go ahead, Amy, say I’m annoying. I’m annoying. I’m annoying. I’m annoying. Yeah, now, uh, now where are you going? Look, you know you want to say it, say it. Say I’m annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say it. Amy, say it. Well, she can’t stand it when I’m right."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Amy,This is fun. I’m going to feel like such a vixen wearing jewellery that doesn’t have a list of medications I’m allergic to.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,"Penny, how’s it going over there?"
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Penny,"Good, I’m just having little trouble with the glue."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Amy,How do you not know how to use glue? Did you ditch pre-school?
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Penny,"Yeah, but only because I was dating a second grader."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,"Hello, everyone."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,"Okay, let me have it. Let’s hear all the Raj is a girl jokes."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,Nope. Bernadette told me it isn’t nice and I’m not allowed.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,Thank you.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,"So I won’t be making fun of you, or the things you like, or the fact that you just want to have fu-un."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,"Howie, stop. Come on, look at what I’m making."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,"Oh, that’s actually pretty nice."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Amy,I’m making a bracelet.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Penny,"Yeah, I’m just making a mess."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,"You know, instead of beads and glue, you guys can use my soldering iron. You’d be able to make much cooler stuff."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,"Oh, I think we’re doing just fine, thank you."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Amy,"Actually, I’d kind of like to try that."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,"Me, too."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,Be right back.

Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Professor Proton’s house.,Arthur,"Of course you woke me, it’s seven thirty."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Professor Proton’s house.,Sheldon,"Well, I would have been here sooner, but for some reason your home isn’t on this map of Hollywood stars."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Professor Proton’s house.,Arthur,"What do you want, Sheldon?"
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Professor Proton’s house.,Sheldon,It’s been pointed out by my girlfriend that I may have been annoying to you.

Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Professor Proton’s house.,Arthur,"Sheldon, in a couple hours I have to get up, pee and then wander around the house."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Professor Proton’s house.,Sheldon,"Well, then, I’ll make this quick. Um, I want to talk about the paper you sent Leonard. Now, I know he said it’s promising and he’s going to collaborate on it, but now that you and I are friends again, I am at your disposal. And, um, frankly, lending my name and reputation to it will help, because a lot of people think that you’re a washed-up has-been. Or dead."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Professor Proton’s house.,Arthur,I should be so lucky.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Professor Proton’s house.,Sheldon,"So, uh, what do you say?"
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Professor Proton’s house.,Arthur,"You know, if it’s all the same with you, I, I think I’ll, I’ll stick with Leonard."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Professor Proton’s house.,Sheldon,"It’s because I’m annoying, right? I know it is. Say it. Say it. Say I’m annoying."

Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Leonard’s laboratory.,Leonard,"If you would have told me when I was a kid that someday I would be doing science next to Professor Proton, I would not have believed you."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Leonard’s laboratory.,Arthur,"If someone had told me that people would still call me Professor Proton when I was 83 years old, I never would have quit smoking."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Leonard’s laboratory.,Leonard,"I’m sorry, Dr. Jeffries, I’m just excited. This nano vacuum tube idea of yours is, it’s really interesting."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Leonard’s laboratory.,Sheldon,"Hello, Leonard. Oh, hello, Arthur. What an odd coincidence that you’re both here."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Leonard’s laboratory.,Leonard,Why is it odd?
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Leonard’s laboratory.,Sheldon,"Because as it just so happens, I’m also spending the day with a beloved children’s television science personality. Isn’t that right, new friend and colleague Bill Nye the Science Guy. Sorry, I replaced you with a newer model."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Leonard’s laboratory.,Bill Nye,"Wow, Arthur Jeffries. It’s an honour to meet you. My show never would have happened without yours."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Leonard’s laboratory.,Arthur,That’s what I told my lawyers.

Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Leonard’s laboratory.,Bill,He said I’d be speaking to a class.

Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,What’s going on with them?
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Penny’s apartment.,Raj,They’re just having a little trouble communicating. My dad says it’s because the sound of my mom’s voice makes him want to tear his ears off and sew them over his eyes so he never has to look at her again.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,Hi.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Hey, guys."

Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Penny’s apartment.,Howard,Sorry we’re late. I wanted to swing by the lab and pick up some even cooler tools for us to use.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Penny’s apartment.,Raj,I didn’t know you were coming again.

Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Penny’s apartment.,Amy,"So, what tools did you bring?"
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Penny’s apartment.,Howard,"Everything we need to make jewellery moulds. Here’s some silver, a crucible and an acetylene torch to melt it down."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Ooh, that looks like fun."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,Maybe you should master glue before you move on to fire.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Penny’s apartment.,Howard,"Okay, who’s up first?"
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Penny’s apartment.,Amy,"Rajesh, do you want to make a bracelet for your mom to go with the necklace?"

Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Leonard’s laboratory.,Leonard,"Oh, God."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Leonard’s laboratory.,Arthur,"What, what is it?"
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Leonard’s laboratory.,Leonard,Sheldon just sent me a picture of him and Bill Nye getting smoothies.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Leonard’s laboratory.,Arthur,"Can, can I ask you a question?"
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Leonard’s laboratory.,Leonard,"Yeah, sure."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Leonard’s laboratory.,Arthur,Why do you put up with Sheldon?
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Leonard’s laboratory.,Leonard,"Oh, uh, you know, because we’re friends."

Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Leonard’s laboratory.,Leonard,"Wow, you ask really hard questions."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Leonard’s laboratory.,Arthur,Yeah.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Leonard’s laboratory.,Leonard,"Look, I know he can be aggravating, but what you have to remember is that he’s not doing it on purpose. It’s just how he is. But he’s also loyal and trustworthy and we have fun together."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Leonard’s laboratory.,Arthur,"You, you know you’re describing a dog."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Leonard’s laboratory.,Leonard,"He did bite me once. But in his defence, I came up behind him while he was eating, so…"
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Leonard’s laboratory.,Arthur,"Yeah, they, they hate that."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Leonard’s laboratory.,Leonard,"You know what, Sheldon is the smartest person I have ever met. And he’s a little broken and he needs me. I guess I need him, too."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Leonard’s laboratory.,Arthur,"Why, why is that?"
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Leonard’s laboratory.,Leonard,"Boy, you will not let this go, will you? Oh, jeez."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Leonard’s laboratory.,Arthur,Another photo from Sheldon?
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Leonard’s laboratory.,Leonard,"No, I have to go pick him up. Bill Nye ditched him at the smoothie place."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Leonard’s laboratory.,Arthur,"He probably stole his wallet, too."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Penny’s apartment.,Howard,"You know, if you guys are interested, there’s a technique where I can take a lock of your hair, refine it into carbon dust and use the hydraulic press at work to turn it into a tiny little diamond with your DNA in it."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Oh, that’s amazing,"
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Penny’s apartment.,Howard,Yeah. See Bernie’s engagement ring? That came right off my mom’s back.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,"He’s kidding. If that were true, it’d be so much bigger."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Penny’s apartment.,Raj,My name is Howard. I can make your hair into diamonds. My mom is morbidly obese. Everybody love me.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Penny’s apartment.,Howard,"Whoa, where is that coming from?"
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Penny’s apartment.,Raj,I’ll tell you where it’s coming from. All you do is make fun of me for coming to girls’ night and now you’re here ruining it for everyone.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Raj, cool it, he’s gonna make us hair diamonds."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Penny’s apartment.,Howard,How am I ruining anything? I’m just trying to help you make better jewellery.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Penny’s apartment.,Raj,But this isn’t about the jewellery. This is about me having a place where I can open up about my feelings.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Penny’s apartment.,Howard,Since when can’t you open up with me?
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Penny’s apartment.,Raj,"There are just some things that I feel more comfortable sharing with the girls, because they won’t make fun of me or and call me names, or ask me if my Koothrapanties are in a bunch."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Penny’s apartment.,Howard,"Buddy, I was just joking around."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Penny’s apartment.,Raj,"Yeah, well, sometimes your jokes hurt."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Penny’s apartment.,Howard,You’re right. I didn’t realize I was making you feel that way. It was very brave of you to tell me.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Penny’s apartment.,Raj,Thank you. It wasn’t easy.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Penny’s apartment.,Amy,"They’re gonna have sex before Sheldon and I do, I know it."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Sheldon,Arthur?
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Arthur,"Hi, Sheldon."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Sheldon,I’m surprised to see you here.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Arthur,"Yeah, me, too. Somewhere around the third floor I began to see a, a white light."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Sheldon,I’ll get Leonard.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Arthur,"No, no, no, I’m, I’m here, I’m here to see you."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Sheldon,"If you’re hoping to get in touch with Bill Nye, I can’t help you. I’ve been informed that he’s now Bill Nye the Restraining Order Guy."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Arthur,"No, I, I, I was thinking, if it isn’t too much trouble, I’d like to get your opinion about my, my paper."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Sheldon,Thank you. It would be an honour.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Arthur,"Oh. Uh, great."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Actually, I don’t need that. I hacked into your e-mail account and read it."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Arthur,"And, what did you think?"
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, first, I think the fact that you use your birthday as a password is embarrassing."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Arthur,Mmm. Thank you.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Second, um, I thought your paper was inspired."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Arthur,"Oh, well, that, that means a lot to me."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Sheldon,Can I invite you in for tea?
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Arthur,"Uh, no, no. I, I really, I have, I have to run."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Penny,"Hey, Arthur. How are you?"
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Arthur,"Well, I guess one cup wouldn’t hurt."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,"Oh, hey, buddy, what’s up?"
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,"Well, I was feeling bad about how I acted the other night so I made you a little something."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,You didn’t have to do that.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,"Well, it was fun. I used some of the jewellery techniques you taught us. It’s a lightsabre belt buckle."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,"Wow, this is so cool. Thanks."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,Oh gets better.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,Wow.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,"And that’s not even the best part. See? I have one, too. Check it out. You can wear yours and we can have little sword fights whenever we want."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Yeah, and my eighth favourite episode of Professor Proton was Alka-Seltzer rocket. You said, plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh, what a blast-off it is. Remember? Remember that? Remember?"
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Leonard,He can’t help it. He can’t. He really can’t.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, wait here. I’ll get some Alka-Seltzer, we can build that rocket, and we can shoot it at Bill Nye’s house. As long as I’m not within 500 feet of it."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Arthur,"So, you, uh, you have, you have any, single grandmothers?"
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Penny,"Sorry, they’re both married."
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Arthur,Good.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Penny,Mmm.
Series 07,Episode 07,The Proton Displacement,The apartment.,Arthur,"Hap, hap, happily?"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Penny,"Hey, can I ask you a question?"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Leonard,Sure.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Penny,"You’ve had this dart board since I’ve known you, but I’ve never seen you play."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Leonard,"Oh, uh, we played, once. I broke a window."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Penny,What window?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Leonard,That one over there.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Sheldon,"Leonard, where are the Skee-Ball tickets?"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Leonard,Skee-Ball tickets?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Sheldon,"Yeah, from when we went to the arcade three years ago? I finally decided what prize I want. Hurry up."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Leonard,"Uh, if I still have them, they’re probably in the junk box."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Penny,"Ooh, what are you gonna get?"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Sheldon,"None of your business. But when you see me wearing a flower in my lapel later, you are most welcome to sniff it."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Leonard,"Yup, oh, here you go."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Sheldon,"Oh, thank you. Here, get yourself an eraser for your troubles."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Leonard,Oh. I forgot about this. My aunt made it for me when I started college.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Penny,"Aw, did she hate you?"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Leonard,"Why? Because I got an ugly, itchy sweater, and my brother got a car? No, I was her favorite."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Sheldon,I seem to be a few tickets short. Are there more in the box?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Leonard,"Hmm, I think I got them all. Nope, they’re not in there."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Sheldon,"Well, you barely looked. Let me see."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Leonard,"No, no, no, I, I looked, and there’s, there’s, there’s no more tickets."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Sheldon,"Leonard, let me look in the box."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Leonard,"Okay, okay. I’m gonna show you what’s in the box. But just promise not to flip out."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Sheldon,Why would I flip out? Is it a spider? It’s a spider.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Penny,"No, if it was a spider, Lenny would’ve flipped out."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Leonard,"Okay, Sheldon, I know I was supposed to return this DVD a long time ago, and I know we rented it on your card. But it’s been, like, seven years and clearly nothing bad has happened. So in-in-in-instead of being a giant pain in the ass like you always are, what if this one time you just tried staying calm?"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Sheldon,"That seems like a reasonable request. Although so did, hey, Leonard, would you mind returning that DVD?"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Leonard,"I’m sorry. I’ll, I’ll take care of it."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Sheldon,Okay.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Leonard,"I mean it, I’m going to."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Sheldon,I believe you.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Leonard,And you’re going to stay calm?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Sheldon,I said I would.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Leonard,How about that? Sheldon’s being reasonable.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,Penny,"Yeah, it’s freaking me out. I’m gonna go."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment,,Credits sequence.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Leonard,"So, when you say you’re not going to freak out about the DVD, here’s what that means. Don’t fixate on it. Don’t wake me up in the middle of the night. Or nag me through the door while I’m on the toilet."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Okay, first, talking to you while you’re on the toilet isn’t exactly a picnic for me either, okay? Remember, when you can hear me, I can hear you. And second, you completely disregard how uncomfortable unresolved issues are for me. It’s, it’s like, a, an itch in my brain I can’t scratch."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Leonard,When I broke my arm I used to stick a coat hanger down there. You ever try that? Maybe go in through the ear?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,You wouldn’t make jokes if you could feel the way I feel.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Well, I don’t know how to do that."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"How about this? I promise I won’t pester you about the DVD. You can defecate in peace. That’s a win for both of us. But, until this matter is resolved, I would like you to wear this sweater. With nothing underneath it."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Leonard,That’s stupid. Why?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,You say it’s itchy and uncomfortable. I say situations like this make me feel the same way.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Leonard,"I’m telling you, try the hanger."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Put it on. Let’s share the experience.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Leonard,"You got it. If this sweater shuts you up, I’m gonna make a fortune selling them to everyone we know. Now all I need to do is head down to the video store and return the DVD."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, did I forget to tell you? That store went out of business years ago."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Leonard,Really?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"How those nipples feeling, chief?"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory bar.,Bernadette,"Penny, can we please get our drinks?"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory bar.,Penny,"Yeah, hang on, just give me sec."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory bar.,Amy,"At work today, I did an in vivo stereotaxic surgery."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory bar.,Bernadette,"Cool. At my lab, I performed ten laser capture micro-dissections."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory bar.,Penny,I scraped gum off the bottom of that table. Only ’cause my manager saw me put it there.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory bar.,Amy,"Oh, my gosh. That’s the girl that broke Rajesh’s heart."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory bar.,Bernadette,That’s Lucy?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory bar.,Penny,I don’t know why but I always pictured her as Indian.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory bar.,Bernadette,I think that reason’s called racism.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory bar.,Penny,I’m gonna go talk to her.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory bar.,Bernadette,Why? What are you gonna say?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory bar.,Penny,I’m not gonna say anything. I just want to check her out. Because she hurt my friend. My Indian friend. Who’s racist now?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory bar.,Bernadette,You because you just called him your Indian friend.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory bar.,Penny,"Yeah, well, you’re short."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory bar.,Amy,We’re never getting our drinks.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory bar.,Bernadette,"No, but we knew that."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory bar.,Penny,"Hey, can I start you off with something to drink?"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory bar.,Lucy,"Oh, water would be great."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory bar.,Penny,"Okay. Um, you’re Lucy, right? I’m a friend of Raj Koothrappali’s. Actually Amy recognized you."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory bar.,Lucy,Wow. How’s he doing?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory bar.,Penny,"Oh, you know, he’s good."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory bar.,Lucy,Great.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory bar.,Penny,"Yeah, this is none of my business. But why did you break up with him in an e-mail?"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory bar.,Lucy,"Oh, I don’t know. I guess I thought it would be easier."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory bar.,Penny,"Yeah, I get that. I’ll go get you your water. When you say easier, you mean easier for you, right? ‘Cause it certainly didn’t make it easier for him."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory bar.,Lucy,Any chance I can get a different waitress?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory bar.,Penny,"I’m sorry, this is rude of me. I will go get that water. See, see, see, see. Just now you expressed your feelings to my face. How come you could do that with me, but not Raj?"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory bar.,Lucy,I don’t know your e-mail.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory bar.,Penny,"You know what the worst part is? You’re sitting here, perfectly happy and he’s at home, a blubbering mess."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory bar.,Lucy,"Oh, I thought you said he was okay."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory bar.,Penny,"Well, I also said I was getting you water, but look at me still standing here. You know, I may be a bad waitress, but you are a bad person. Now, you want to hear the specials?"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Howard,"So, you can never take it off?"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Leonard,No.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Raj,Not even to sleep?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Leonard,No.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Howard,"So, you’re just an idiot?"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Leonard,It’s called proving a point.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Howard,Is the point that you’re an idiot?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Gentlemen, please. Leonard is trying to walk a mile in my metaphorical shoes. He can’t walk in my actual shoes. He has the feet of a toddler."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Raj,"So, how are you gonna return the DVD if the store went out of business?"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Monday morning I’ll go downtown, look up the owner’s information and send him the DVD. Pay the late fee, and prove to Sheldon that you can have a problem and solve it without acting like a complete lunatic. Ah!"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Howard,And the man impersonating a bear would like everyone to know that only you can prevent forest fires.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Raj,I don’t get it.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Howard,You didn’t have Smokey the Bear in India?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Raj,"No. Oh, is he anything like, uh, Mun-Mun the Mongoose? He taught us not to play with cobras."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Howard,You had to be taught not to play with cobras?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Raj,You had to be taught not to burn down the forest?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Hey, if you guys were hungry, why didn’t you order something at the restaurant?"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,"We did, you never brought it."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Oh, that’s right. Nachos and a turkey club."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Penny’s apartment.,Amy,Not even close.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Well, I was too busy standing up for my friend to worry about your, I want to say salmon."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Penny’s apartment.,Amy,You want to say sorry.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,"So, how are you gonna tell Raj abut what you did?"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,What do you mean how? What’s the big deal?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Penny’s apartment.,Amy,You told Lucy he was a pathetic mess.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,Then you made her cry and leave.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Okay, you guys are overreacting. Raj is gonna appreciate how I had his back."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,"The same, later.",Raj,"What is wrong with you, Penny? You ruined any chance I had of getting back with Lucy. Now she knows I’m a desperate mess instead of just being pretty sure.(Phone text sound)It’s Lucy. She wants to meet for coffee. I love you, Penny."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Sheldon’s office.,Howard,"Hey, what’re you working on?"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Sheldon’s office.,Sheldon,I’m thinking about how one could use the fact that a rapidly rotating mirror turns virtual photons into real ones as a method of observing dark energy.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Sheldon’s office.,Howard,That’s a pretty cool idea.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Sheldon’s office.,Sheldon,Yeah. It’s great you’re here. I’d love to get an engineer’s opinion.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Sheldon’s office.,Howard,Sure.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Sheldon’s office.,Sheldon,"This chair is squeaky. Now, do I fix it or get a new one?"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Sheldon’s office.,Leonard,"Well, Sheldon, it took me all morning, but I found the owner of the video store. And I am happy to report that he died peacefully in his sleep, drunk at the bottom of a pool. Anyway, there is no one to return the DVD to, so this issue is resolved. Ah! And I’d just like to point out that even though the sweater was uncomfortable, I didn’t use it as an excuse to antagonize everyone around me."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Sheldon’s office.,Howard,"You know, you could reimburse the video store owner’s next of kin."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Sheldon’s office.,Leonard,Or it’s resolved.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Sheldon’s office.,Sheldon,"Hey, that next of kin thing sounds pretty good."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Sheldon’s office.,Howard,I believe this is yours.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,"Can I ask you guys a question? So, I’m seeing Lucy tomorrow night, and I’ve never hung out with someone who broke up with me. How do you do it?"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,"You can’t let her know you’re hurting. You know, the key is confidence."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,Why is the key always confidence? How come it’s never love handles and flop sweat?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,"If this girl hurt you so much, are you sure you want to see her again?"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,"Well, if I may, he has so little self-respect and is so desperate for the smallest crumb of affection, she could literally sleep with his own father in his own bed and post the video to YouTube, and he’d still buy her flowers and ask her to be his bride."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,"He’s right. But in my defence, if we could survive that, we could survive anything."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,"Well, if you’re sure you want to do this, it’s only coffee, just relax and see what happens."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,"Well, can I say she looks nice?"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,Sure.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,Can I tell her I miss her?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,"Maybe, if she asks."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,"Oh, can I show her an oil painting I made of us surrounded by our children and grandchildren?"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,I’d save that for the second date.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,"Good, good. ‘Cause no matter how hard I try, I cannot get the twins to look alike."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,What are you doing?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, I’m just trying to find the stupid next of kin to this stupid video store owner so I can return the DVD and see the look on Sheldon’s stupid face when he sees that I didn’t let this get to me."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,Sheldon’s not here. Why don’t you take the sweater off?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,There’s a principle at stake.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,Which is?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, I don’t know. Who cares? Look at me."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Oh, my God! Is that sweater made of bees? Come on, take it off. I won’t tell."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"No, no, honey, if I take it off, Sheldon wins."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Sweetie, every night you don’t kill him in his sleep, he wins."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"No, it’s, it’s almost done. I just, I have to find the next of kin, and send ’em the DVD and then just wait for someone with my complexion to die so I can get a skin graft."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,Smile.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,What is that? What is that for?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,So you can send it to Princeton and get your money back.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Amy,"I must say, Sheldon, you’re handling this DVD business with an impressive amount of maturity."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,I don’t know why that surprises you. I’m a grown man. As should be evident by this sport coat and very real flower in my lapel.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Amy,Is there some kind of new coping mechanism you’re employing?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"The more interesting question you should be asking is, what does this flower smell like?"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Amy,I’m gonna go with sad. So what’s the story with you and this DVD?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"There’s nothing to tell. Maybe I purchased a book entitled Don’t Sweat the Small Stuff and I followed its wise suggestions, one of which was stop and smell the flowers."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Amy,Seriously?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Please. Ha-ha, Oh."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,A coffee shop.,Lucy,Hi.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,A coffee shop.,Raj,"Hello. Oh, it’s so good to see you."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,A coffee shop.,Lucy,"You, too."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,A coffee shop.,Raj,"Please, sit. I, uh, I got you a cappuccino. I remembered it was your favourite. I also got crumb cake, but I remembered it was my favourite and I ate it. Anyway, uh, how are you?"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,A coffee shop.,Lucy,"I’m pretty good. Listen, I just wanted to apologize for breaking up with you in an e-mail."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,A coffee shop.,Raj,"Well, and I ate all the crumb cake. We both made mistakes."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,A coffee shop.,Lucy,Okay.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,A coffee shop.,Raj,"I’m so happy you asked me here, and I hope we can hang out again sometime. You know, as friends, lovemaking partners, whatever."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,A coffee shop.,Lucy,"Oh, uh, I’m kind of seeing someone."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,A coffee shop.,Raj,"I think I know the answer to this, but just to be clear, it’s not me, right?"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Penny’s apartment.,Raj,"This is all your fault, I should’ve listened to Mun-Mun because I’ve been playing with a cobra and her name is Penny. Why are you so cruel? Do you enjoy my pain?"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,There’s a girl at the Cheesecake Factory I can set you up with.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Penny’s apartment.,Raj,"I love you, Penny."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,How is it I can conceptualize a methodology of examining dark matter in the universe but can’t figure out how to fix a novelty squirt flower?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Amy,"I think the real question is, why do you waste your time with cheap, childish pranks?"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,There’s probably a deep reason. Which I’d be happy to discuss with you over some peanut brittle in a can.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Okay, Sheldon, I am out of options. Video store owner, Nursis Manookian, has no next of kin."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, you seem hot under the collar, or is that the sweater?"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, oh, no, no. It’s because I spent all afternoon at the Armenian church where his funeral mass was held. According to Father Solakian, no one attended. Luckily, my trip wasn’t a complete waste. I lit a candle and prayed for your death but I’m not Armenian, so it probably won’t work. This is over, right?"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, not necessarily. I suggest you look for long-lost relatives either in Armenia or Lebanon."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Listen to me, Sheldon. I am not going to Lebanon to return Super Mario Brothers the movie."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"You know, it might be fun. You love hummus."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Leonard,Why isn’t this bothering you? Isn’t your brain getting itchy? This is on your card. This could be ruining your credit score. Why isn’t this making you crazy?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Leonard, I have something to tell you, but I want you to promise not to flip out."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Leonard,What?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Seven years ago, I found out the DVD was late and I paid for it."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Leonard,What?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"I was going to mention it at the time, but then I thought, some day, this might be a teachable moment."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Aaaah! I, you, how can, what!"
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Amy,"Sheldon, that was diabolical."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,I know. And it wasn’t easy. Do you have any idea what it’s like to wait for years and never know if you’re going to finally get satisfaction?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,A coffee shop.,Raj,Wow. You’re even prettier than Penny said. I can’t believe a girl like you doesn’t have a boyfriend.
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,A coffee shop.,Girl,"Well, I don’t."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,A coffee shop.,Raj,"I don’t believe you, you’re lying to me."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,A coffee shop.,Girl,What?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,A coffee shop.,Raj,"Oh, it’s okay. I have no morals and I’m desperately lonely. I’ll be the other man if you want a little something-something on the side."
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,The cheesecake factory.,Girl(to Penny),What is wrong with you?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Penny’s apartment.,Penny(to Raj),What is wrong with you?
Series 07,Episode 08,The Itchy Brain Simulation,Raj’s apartment.,Raj(to a mirror),What is wrong with you?
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Leonard,The math is all there. It’s not real.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Penny,"Yes, it is."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Yeah,uh, look, it is scientifically impossible for a person to tip a cow. Even you, with your stocky build and lumberjack shoulders, you couldn’t do it."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Raj,It’s horrible. Why would you push a cow over? They’re sacred.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Penny,"Oh, stop it. I’ve seen you eat, like, a million hamburgers."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Raj,"Hey, an animal can be both sacred and delicious."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Penny,"Look, I’m telling you I’ve done it, okay? I clearly remember the cow standing up and then the cow on its side."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Leonard,Were you drunk?
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Penny,I was 16 in Nebraska. What do you think?
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Leonard,I think you’re the one who fell over.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Penny,That would explain why the sky was also on its side.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Howard,Hey.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Penny,Howard. Cow tipping. Real or not?
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Howard,"Mmm. I’m gonna say not. That’s just based on me trying to roll my mom over when she’s snoring. Speaking of that big side of beef, uh, she’s invited all of you to Thanksgiving at her house."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Mmm. You know, I’ve been told that a bald refusal of an invitation is rude and one must instead offer up a polite excuse, so I’d love to go, but, unfortunately, that sounds awful."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Howard,"Come on, it’ll be fun."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Penny,"Uh, we were actually gonna do it here."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Howard,"Please? Bernadette’s bringing her dad ’cause her mom’s out of town, and I never have anything to say to that guy."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, since you put it that way, I’d love to go, but that sounds even more awful."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Leonard,It’d actually be nice to not hear Sheldon complain about my cooking all day.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Uh, excuse me, but every year you prepare a terrible meal and every year I criticize it. Do our traditions mean nothing to you?"
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Leonard,I want to go.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Penny,"Yeah, me, too."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Raj,I’m in.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Howard,Sheldon.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Ugh, fine, I’ll go. But if her food is delicious, Thanksgiving is ruined, and it’s on you."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,,Credits sequence.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Sheldon,Do we really have to go to Mrs. Wolowitz’s house?
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Amy,We do. And I expect you to be on your best behaviour.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Sheldon,Now I know how the African slaves felt. Being dragged from their homes to labour under the yoke of the white man.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Amy,Are you honestly comparing Thanksgiving dinner at Wolowitz’s mom’s with one of the greatest tragedies in the history of mankind?
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Sheldon,Yes.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Penny,"Sheldon, you can have a nice Thanksgiving anywhere. I spent one in Vegas."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Leonard,You did?
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Penny,"Yeah, back when I was dating Zack. It was actually more fun than I thought. We gambled, we went to one of those cheesy wedding chapels, we had a really good turkey dinner. Which was surprising, since we were at a strip club."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Leonard,"Wait, you went to a chapel?"
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Penny,Yeah.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Leonard,Why?
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Penny,We had one of those silly fake weddings.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Leonard,"Penny, you know those are real, right?"
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Penny,"No, they’re not."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Leonard,"Yeah, they are."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Penny,"No, they’re not."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Leonard,"Yeah, they are."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Sheldon,He’s right.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Amy,They’re real.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Penny,But it didn’t seem real.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Let me ask you a question. At any point, was Las Vegas on its side?"

Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,Mrs Wolowitz’s house.,Mike,"Uh, okay, yeah, it’s for everybody. I really just wanted to have a nice, quiet day at home and watch the game."

Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,Leonard’s car.,Sheldon,"Oh, oh, oh, I have a reason. It could be because you said yes to marrying Zack, but every time Leonard’s proposed, he’s gotten a resounding no. Yeah, that’s just off the top of my head."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,Leonard’s car.,Penny,So how do I undo this?
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,Leonard’s car.,Leonard,I’m hoping you can get an annulment. It’s just like it never happened.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,Leonard’s car.,Penny,"Great, well, what do I have to do?"
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,Leonard’s car.,Amy,It says here you can get an annulment if any of the following conditions are met. Were you unable to consummate the marriage?
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,Leonard’s car.,Sheldon,Hah!Penny? Next.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,Leonard’s car.,Amy,"Is there any evidence of fraud, bigamy, want of understanding?"

Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,Mrs Wolowitz’s kitchen.,Bernadette,I’ll help Raj in here. Why don’t you go keep my dad company?
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,Mrs Wolowitz’s kitchen.,Howard,He doesn’t want me in there. I’m the creepy little guy who has sex with his daughter.

Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Howard,What’s with you?
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Leonard,"Oh, she’s mad at me because she just found out she’s married to Zack."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Howard,Really? That dumb-ass she used to date? That’s hysterical.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Penny,I can’t believe I felt bad for opening this in the car.

Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The kitchen.,Amy,"Uh, sure."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The kitchen.,Raj,"Great. That makes one of you. Okay, we have a lot to do and not much time to do it. Bernadette, you’re on corn, gravy and yam detail. Amy, you’re on rolls, cranberries and making sure Bernadette stays away from the marshmallows. That’s right, I see you. Okay, if you have any questions, I’ll be over here basting my ass off. Focus is key."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The kitchen.,Amy,Did you guys know Penny married Zack three years ago?
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The kitchen.,Together,What?
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Howard,You ever play football?
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Mike,A little in college. You?
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Howard,No. But I did get tackled in the hallway once. The whole school cheered.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Leonard,"Okay, I found the, uh, court papers that you and Zack need to fill out. I’ll print them when we get home."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Penny,Fine.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Leonard,And we can just put this whole thing behind us.

Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Leonard,What?
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Penny,"Look, I get it, I screwed up. Is this all we’re gonna talk about the rest of the day?"
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Leonard,Why are you mad at me? You’re the one that did the stupid thing. I’m just trying to fix it.

Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Leonard,How am I the bad guy? She’s the one who married someone else. I’m the victim.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Howard,Sounds like Zack’s the victim. You’re sleeping with his wife.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Mike,I’ve kept my marriage together for 35 years. Can I weigh in here?
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Leonard,Sure.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Mike,"I’m trying to watch the game. Shut up. Oh, how do you not make a first down there?"
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Sheldon,They passed against a nickel defence. They should have run it off-tackle.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Mike,How the hell do you know that?
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Sheldon,My father loved football. He always made me watch it before I was allowed to do my homework.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Penny,"Well, you’ll be happy to know I just spoke to Zack and he’s willing to sign the court papers. He’s on his way here now."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Leonard,"Wait, you invited him here?"
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Penny,Yeah.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Mike,I’m getting ready to weigh in again.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Leonard,Come on.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Mike,What do you think they ought to do now?
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Sheldon,"I would throw a quick slant to a wideout, given that the defence is showing blitz."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Howard,"Oh, I love a good blitz, especially with sour cream. Get it? ‘Cause it sounds like blintz."

Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The dining room.,Penny,"Because you wouldn’t shut up about it. When I called him, he had nothing to do, so I just thought it would…"

Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Sheldon,I don’t care for your mother’s bathroom. There’s not an angle to do one’s business without a clown figurine staring at you.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Howard,That’s why I sit.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Mike,"Yeah, that’s why. You remember the Thanksgiving game when it snowed in Dallas?"
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Sheldon,1993. Leon Lett blew the game in the final seconds and the Dolphins emerged victorious. Then I finally got to do my calculus.

Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Sheldon,So was my dad. And then he did.

Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Mike,"So, does your dad still live in Texas?"
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Sheldon,No. He died when I was 14.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Mike,I’m sorry to hear that.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Sheldon,So was the man who owned the local liquor store. He cried and cried.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Howard,Here you go.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Mike,"Oh, thanks. So, if your dad died when you were 14, you were never old enough to have a beer with the man."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Sheldon,"No, sir. He did try to give me one for my high school graduation, but I was 11 and my mom said no."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Mike,"Well, you’re having one with me."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Sheldon,All right.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Mike,To your dad.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The living room.,Howard,"I never had a beer with my dad, either."

Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The kitchen.,Amy,"Broad shoulders, good hair."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The kitchen.,Raj,Hmm. Wonder what she sees in Leonard.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The kitchen.,Bernadette,How’s it going out there?
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The kitchen.,Howard,Sheldon and your dad are bonding and completely ignoring me.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The kitchen.,Amy,I know how you feel. Sheldon ignored me for a week when he got that Roomba vacuum. I kick it when he’s not looking.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The kitchen.,Bernadette,What are they doing?
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The kitchen.,Howard,They’re drinking beer and watching football.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The kitchen.,Bernadette,So why don’t you do that with them?
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The kitchen.,Howard,They don’t want me.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The kitchen.,Bernadette,What do you mean?
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The kitchen.,Howard,"Well, Sheldon started talking about how his dad isn’t alive any more, and they were toasting, and I tried to tell them about how sad I was when my dad abandoned…"
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The kitchen.,Amy,Zack’s here!

Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The dining room.,Leonard,Sorry she made you come over here on a holiday.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The dining room.,Zack,"It’s all right. I didn’t have anything going on. Plus, Penny told me we’re married, and Thanksgiving’s a time to be with family."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The dining room.,Penny,"Yeah, okay, great. Can we just get this over with?"
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The dining room.,Leonard,"Yeah, uh, you guys have to sign here and here. On Monday, we’ll file for the annulment, and this marriage will be over."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The dining room.,Penny,Okay.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The dining room.,Zack,I don’t know if I want to sign it.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The dining room.,"Raj, Bernadette and Amy",Ooh.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The dining room.,Leonard,Why won’t you sign it?
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The dining room.,Zack,I just think splitting up can be rough on kids.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The dining room.,Penny,We don’t have any kids.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The dining room.,Zack,Are you sure? ‘Cause you didn’t know we were married until this morning.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The dining room.,Penny,"Okay, look, Zack, come on. You know neither of us thought this was real. I mean, we were married by an Elvis impersonator."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The dining room.,Zack,Of course it was an impersonator. We could never afford a real Elvis.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The dining room.,Leonard,You married him instead of me? Good call. Sign the papers.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The dining room.,Penny,"Hang on. You know what? You have been a jerk about this all day. You always do this, whenever I mess up, you’re right there to make me feel even worse about it."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The dining room.,Leonard,That is not true.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The dining room.,Penny,"Yeah, we could’ve waited till Monday, signed the papers, this all would have been over."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The dining room.,Leonard,You’re the one who invited him here.
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The dining room.,Penny,"Oh, there you go again, just another mistake you’re throwing in my face."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The dining room.,Zack,"Not cool, bro. I’m starting to think you’re not the kind of guy I want dating my wife."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The dining room.,Leonard,"Yeah, well, she’s not gonna be your wife for long."
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The dining room.,Zack,"Oh, no. Are you dying?"
Series 07,Episode 09,The Thanksgiving Decoupling,The dining room.,Penny,I’m about to. Sign the paper.

For your information, I have nine friends, hmm? Ten if we include you. Nine it is. Ah, it’s ten. I’ll count Wolowitz. Hello, friend Leonard."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Hey, you’re in a good mood."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,I’m in a great mood.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Well, you’re about to be in an even better one. I didn’t want to say anything until I knew for sure, but, I’ve been re-running the tests on your element in my lab and I disproved it. Your element does not exist."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Yeah, but what about the Chinese research team? They found it."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Yeah, it turns out someone added simulated signals to the data files. They faked the results."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Really?
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Leonard,Yes. Do you know what that means? That means all of this attention that you hate goes away.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,So no more interviews?
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Leonard,"No, it’s all over."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,I can’t believe it.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Well, you’re welcome."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,You robbed me of my greatest achievement.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Leonard,What?
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"I’m back down to nine friends. Make it eight, I’m sick of Wolowitz, too."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Leonard,"I, I don’t understand. All you’ve done since you discovered this stupid element was complain. I was trying to make you happy."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"By taking away my only claim to fame? Well, if you wanted to make me happy, you could have told me a joke. Or shown me a cute video of a koala and an otter becoming unlikely friends."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, there is no winning with you. And koalas and otters don’t even live near each other."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"That’s what makes their friendship unlikely,"
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Penny,"Hey, what’s with all the yelling?"
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Leonard disproved my element. Now all the attention is going to go away.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Penny,"Oh, that’s great. You must be thrilled,"
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"That’s it, I’m down to seven friends."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Penny,"He’s counting hobbits and superheroes, right?"
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"When I thought the element was real, I didn’t want it. But now that Leonard made it not exist, I want it more than anything in the world."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Leonard,"The, the element never existed. I didn’t take it away, science took it away. Be mad at science."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Don’t you dare use science against me. Science is my best friend. Oh, good, I’m back up to eight."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Leonard,Will you tell him he’s out of his mind.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Penny,"Actually, I get what he’s saying."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, yes, nine. Welcome back, buddy."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Penny,"It’s like if you’re dating someone you’re not that into, and then they break up with you and then you want them more than ever."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"I have no idea what she’s talking about, but we’re ganging up on you so I agree."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Okay, Sheldon, what do you want me to do, hide the information? If I don’t publish it, it’s just a matter of time before someone else does."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"No, no, of course you have to publish. That’s your responsibility as a scientist. Doing otherwise would be unethical. You have no choice."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Fine, I’ll publish."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Can you believe this guy?
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,Aw! Raj did the dishes.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,How do you know I didn’t do them?
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,"Because once, when all the knives were dirty, you cut a bagel with your keys."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,"Good morning, everybody. I picked up coffee while I was out. Bernadette, here’s your soy peppermint mocha."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,"Aw, you didn’t have to do that."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,"Oh, my pleasure, and don’t worry about your presentation today. You’re gonna be great."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,"Yeah, you’re gonna knock it out of the park."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,What presentation do I have today?
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,Just go.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,He loves you.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,What are you doing? Are you trying to make me look bad?
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,I’m just being a good house guest.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,"No, you’re being a better husband than I am. Doing the dishes, getting coffee, knowing about her life, who does that?"
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,"Oh, come on, I brought you one, too."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,I don’t want coffee.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,That’s why I got you hot chocolate.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,Give me that. Just stop showing me up.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,"Howard, listen to me. You’re a great husband. Yes, your listening skills could use some work. But it’s amazing how far you’ve come given that you’re an only child raised by an over-protective mom."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,"Um, is this getting weird?"
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,Hang on.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,"So, yes."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Sheldon’s office.,Leonard,"Hey. I just wanted to let you know that I, I posted my findings."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Sheldon’s office.,Sheldon,I saw. And I just posted a retraction of my paper. Now the whole scientific community knows I was wrong.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Sheldon’s office.,Leonard,"These things happen all the time, Sheldon."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Sheldon’s office.,Sheldon,Not to me. The only other retraction I ever had to issue was when I was seven and I conceded that my brother was the greatest ninja in East Texas. But that was just a ploy to get my face out of his armpit.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Sheldon’s office.,Barry,"Thew he is. It’s my favowite superhewo, the Wetwactor."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Sheldon’s office.,Leonard,"Come on, don’t give him a hard time."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Sheldon’s office.,Barry,"I’m sowwy, Cooper. I wetwact it. By the way, Hofstadter, nice job dispwoving the Chinese team."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Sheldon’s office.,Leonard,It’s not a big deal.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Sheldon’s office.,Barry,"It’s a huge deal. Cooper, maybe physics just isn’t your thing. Have you ever considered a caweer in wetail? That way you could take things back for a wiving."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Sheldon’s office.,Leonard,"Okay, Barry, that’s enough."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Sheldon’s office.,Sheldon,"No, no, no, that’s okay. I can fight my own battles. Isn’t that right, Bawwy."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Sheldon’s office.,Barry,"Is? Is that a wefewence to my speech impediment? That’s pwetty hurtful. I, I can’t contwol it."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Sheldon’s office.,Sheldon,"You’re right, That was uncalled for. I take it back."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Sheldon’s office.,Barry,Of course you do. Because you’re the Wetwactor.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,"Raj, this dinner was amazing. If you’re here much longer, I’m gonna have to buy bigger clothes."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,Nonsense. You need a little fattening up. You’ve been looking too skinny lately.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,"Aw. Howie, how come you never say anything sweet like that?"
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,"What are you talking about? Remember last week, when I asked you if you were wearing Spanx and you weren’t? How’s that different?"
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,"Maybe you could try being more thoughtful, like your friend Raj."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,"Yeah, well, maybe you could try being more like Raj."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,"Oh, really?"
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,"Yeah, yeah. He packed me a lunch this morning. And there was a note inside that said go get ’em."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,"Like I don’t do enough around here. Now I need to pack your lunch? And by the way, why do you need a note telling you to go get ’em? You’re a grown man, you should know to go get ’em."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,"I do know to go get ’em, but sometimes it’s nice to have emotional support when I’m going and getting them."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,"Hey, hey, do you hear yourselves? Let’s just, you know, all calm down and take a step back."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,This is stupid. Why are we fighting?
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,I don’t know. I guess I was just feeling like I’m a lousy husband.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,You’re not a lousy husband. You’re a great husband. I was the one feeling like a lousy wife.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,Are you kidding? You’re the best. I know what the problem is. It’s him.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,"Oh, what did I do?"
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,You made us feel like we’re not trying hard enough.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,"Yeah, we were totally fine half-assing our marriage till you showed up."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Raj,"Look, I’m sorry you’re upset with me, but I just have to say it’s nice to see the two of you on the same page."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,"Oh, it does feel good to have you backing me up for once."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,I back you up all the time.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Howard,That is not… he’s doing it again.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.,Bernadette,What is wrong with you?
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Leonard,I can’t believe they kicked you out.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Raj,"I can’t believe they’re still married. Oh, no, I forgot Cinnamon’s toothbrush at Howard’s. I guess you’re sharing with Daddy again."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Penny,Bark once if you need me to call PETA.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,What’s that animal doing in our apartment?
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, relax, she’s in her crate. She can’t get out."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"I have two words for you, Jurassic Park. This day just keeps getting worse and worse."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Penny,"You know, if it makes you feel any better…"
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,It probably won’t.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Penny,You’re probably right.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Amy,"Sheldon, it’s a beautiful night. Why don’t you and I go for a nice walk together?"
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, everything is just sex with you isn’t it?"
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Raj,"Sheldon, I think you might find the support you’re looking for if you realize that relationships are a give and take. She can only be there for you as much as you are for her."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Amy,"Thank you, Rajesh."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Raj,"And, Amy, you need to be patient with Sheldon, instead of pressuring him to accept intimacy on your terms."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The apartment.,Amy,You should probably go.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The radio studio.,Ira,"I’m Ira Flatow, and this is Science Friday. I’d like to welcome back Dr. Sheldon Cooper, who thought he had discovered a new super-heavy element only to have it disproved by my next guest, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. Welcome to Science< Friday, gentlemen."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The radio studio.,Leonard,Thanks.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The radio studio.,Sheldon,"Thank you. Ira, if I may, I’d like to apologize for my behaviour last week."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The radio studio.,Ira,It’s all right.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The radio studio.,Sheldon,"Now, isn’t there something you’d like to say to me?"
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The radio studio.,Ira,"No. Now, Dr. Hofstadter. Can you walk us through the process you used to disprove his theory?"
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The radio studio.,Leonard,Well…
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The radio studio.,Sheldon,I believe I can answer that.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The radio studio.,Leonard,He asked me.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The radio studio.,Sheldon,Fine.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The radio studio.,Leonard,As I was saying…
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The radio studio.,Sheldon,"You’re telling it wrong. Ira, to really understand the story here, you have to start at the very beginning. A small town in East Texas, where a young genius named…"
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The radio studio.,Leonard,Sheldon.
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The radio studio.,Sheldon,"That’s right, Sheldon Cooper. He was bitten by his neighbour’s dog, leading to his first scientific breakthrough, the doggie death-ray. Which, sadly, he couldn’t build because Santa wouldn’t bring him enriched uranium."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The radio studio.,Ira,"You know, I’d really like to hear it from Dr. Hofstadter, if it’s okay with you."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The radio studio.,Sheldon,What a surprise. Did you invite me back just so you could ignore me?
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The radio studio.,Ira,"Actually, I didn’t invite you. You came in, you took a seat, and I’m not comfortable with confrontation."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The radio studio.,Leonard,"Sheldon, this interview is supposed to be about me."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The radio studio.,Sheldon,"Well, that seems like a snooze. Even for public radio."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The radio studio.,Penny(listening in her apartment),"You know, if we did a shot every time they said something embarrassing, this would be one hell of a drinking game."
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The radio studio.,Amy,"A little early for alcohol, isn’t it?"
Series 07,Episode 10,The Discovery Dissipation,The radio studio.,Sheldon,"You know, I don’t just say smart things about science. I also yodel.(Does)"

Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Leonard,What? That’s great. Guys.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Howard,"Oh, yeah"
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Yay, Penny."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Amy,What’s the show?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Penny,"Um, NC… II… or, you know, NCSTD… I don’t know, it’s, it’s, you know, it’s the one with the letters and I’m gonna be on it!"
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Leonard,That’s amazing.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Penny,Yeah.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Howard,What’s your part?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Penny,"Um, I play a customer in a diner and I flirt with Mark Harmon."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Raj,"Ooh, Mark Harmon, he’s a dreamboat."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Leonard,"So it, it’s just flirting?"
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Penny,"Well, yeah. Why?"
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Leonard,"Uh, no reason. I just think it’s sexier when things are left to the imagination."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Amy,He’s wrong.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,,Credits sequence.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The Cheesecake Factory.,Raj,So I read a study that says a man with a dog is three times more likely to get a woman’s phone number.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The Cheesecake Factory.,Leonard,Is it true even when the man lets his dog lick peanut butter off his tongue?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The Cheesecake Factory.,Raj,I don’t see why not.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The Cheesecake Factory.,Howard,"If you’re really desperate to meet women and like having food eaten out of your mouth, I could set you up with my mom."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The Cheesecake Factory.,Sheldon,Why is that funny? That’s just unhygienic.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The Cheesecake Factory.,Leonard,It’s a joke.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The Cheesecake Factory.,Sheldon,"I don’t think so. I believe that a joke is a brief oral narrative with a climactic humorous twist. For example, uh, Wolowitz’s mother is so fat that she decided to go on a diet, or exercise, or both. See? The twist is that people don’t usually change. Well, they don’t."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The Cheesecake Factory.,Penny,"Hey, guys, don’t forget, my episode’s on TV tomorrow night."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The Cheesecake Factory.,Howard,We’ll be there.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The Cheesecake Factory.,Raj,Can we bring anything?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The Cheesecake Factory.,Penny,"Oh, that’s so sweet of you, but I was gonna steal food from here. You know, my treat."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The Cheesecake Factory.,Sheldon,"Wait, if Howard’s mother is coming, then you should also steal marbles. Because she’s obese, and hippos are obese, and in the popular board game Hungry Hungry Hippos, they eat marbles. Maybe I need to dumb these down for you."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Leonard, do you think I’m funny?"
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The stairwell.,Leonard,No. Do you?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The stairwell.,Sheldon,I think I’m hysterical.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The stairwell.,Leonard,I take it back. That was funny.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The stairwell.,Sheldon,The philosopher Henri Bergson says it’s funny when a human being behaves like an object.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The stairwell.,Leonard,I bet that bit killed at The Chuckle Hut.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Oh, he didn’t perform stand-up comedy, he was a philosopher."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The stairwell.,Leonard,"You know, I think we’re zeroing in on your problem."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Perhaps I’ll spend some time developing a unified theory of comedy, which will allow me to elicit laughter from anyone at any time. Unless they’re German, ’cause that’s a tough crowd."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The stairwell.,Leonard,Are you set on people laughing with you? ‘Cause if you’re cool with at you…
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The stairwell.,Sheldon,I don’t get it.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Bernadette’s car.,Bernadette,"Raj, when you said you were gonna bring a date to watch Penny’s thing tonight, I didn’t think you meant Stuart."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Bernadette’s car.,Howard,Really? I never for a second thought it’d be anything else.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Bernadette’s car.,Raj,"I almost met someone last night, but I blew it. I was walking Cinnamon and this girl introduced herself, but she was so cute I panicked and said, wouldn’t it be easier if instead of talking we could just sniff each other’s butts?"
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Bernadette’s car.,Bernadette,"Well, Stuart’s cute in his own way."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Bernadette’s car.,Stuart,"When I was a baby, my mother called me her little possum."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Bernadette’s car.,Raj,Are possums cute?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Bernadette’s car.,Stuart,Not at all.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Bernadette’s car.,Howard,"If you’re so intimidated by talking to attractive girls, maybe you should practice by talking to regular people."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Bernadette’s car.,Raj,You mean like fatties and uggos?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Bernadette’s car.,Bernadette,Or maybe just stop talking.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Bernadette’s car.,Howard,"I’m serious. Go to the mall, talk to anybody, practice, that way when you eventually do talk to a cute girl, it won’t be so scary."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Bernadette’s car.,Bernadette,Or just keep dating the possum.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Voice on television,Parsa doesn’t have those kind of resources.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Second voice,"No, and that’s why he had Erin Pace rewire it…"
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Leonard,I’m so proud of you.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Penny,We haven’t even gotten to my scene yet.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Leonard,"I know, but you’re going to be a TV star and you haven’t left me yet. That takes guts."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Sheldon,"I don’t know about you, but I’m very uncomfortable with all this."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Amy,Why?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Sheldon,I’ve never seen this show before and now I’m starting with episode 246? It’s unnatural.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Amy,Just think of the first 245 as the prequel.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Sheldon,All right.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Penny,"Okay, shh, guys, guys, this is it."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Man on TV,"I guess it’s you and me, kid."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Mark Harmon on TV,What are you doing?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Woman on TV,I’m trying to make peace.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Mark Harmon on TV,We’re good.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Woman on TV,Good.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Mark Harmon on TV,Really? Because…
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Penny,Are you kidding me?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Leonard,What’s wrong?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Penny,"Well, the diner scene. Where’s my diner scene?"
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, don’t ask me. Until I see the prequel, I’m lost."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Penny,"No, there was supposed to be a big scene with me and Mark Harmon, but it’s gone."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Bernadette,What happened?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Penny,They must’ve cut it.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, Penny, I’m, I’m sorry."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Howard,That stinks.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Raj,I’m sure you were great.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Penny,"This doesn’t make any sense. I mean, I, I thought I did a, a really good job, I… Excuse me."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Sheldon,I’ve been studying how to make people laugh. They say that comedy is tragedy plus time. Let’s tickle some ribs.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny(on phone),"No, Dad, I don’t think they cut me out of the show because I was too pretty. No, I don’t need you to come out and kick Mark Harmon’s ass. Daddy, I gotta go. I love you. Bye."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,How you doing?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Ugh, this is such a disaster. My parents had all my relatives over. They got one of those six-foot sandwiches, and got my brother a day pass out of rehab and now he’s missing and the sandwich is missing, and they’re probably in Mexico by now. So humiliating."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,You still got the part. That’s a huge accomplishment.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Yeah, but this was supposed to be my break, okay? People were gonna see me in this show and it was gonna lead to bigger things. More auditions, more parts. Now none of that’s gonna happen."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"Honey, you only had, like, three lines. That wasn’t gonna happen anyway."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,Unbelievable.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, come on, no, that’s not what I meant."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,Then what did you mean?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"I don’t, look, you know, words don’t always have to mean things."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,I think you meant that you don’t believe in me.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"Nope. Uh, uh, I might not know what I meant, but I know that I didn’t mean that. Not this guy. Oh, no way."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"I want you, right now, to give me your 100% honest opinion."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,Right.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,Do you think I have what it takes to really make it as an actress?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,Yes.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,So you think I’ll be on TV and in movies and win awards.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,Honestly?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Yes, honestly."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,I don’t.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,How could you say that?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"I don’t know, I got all confused when you said honestly."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,Oh.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"Look, do I think that you are talented and that you are beautiful? Of course I do. But isn’t Los Angeles full of actresses who are just as talented, just as beautiful? All right, look, we’ll come back to that."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"No, please. Don’t stop, go on. Tell me how I’m gonna be a waitress for the rest of my life."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"That is not what I said. Look, I think you’re really good. I truly do. But this is an incredibly hard thing that you’re shooting for. I mean, the odds of anyone becoming a successful actor are like a million to one."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Wow, thank you."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,Should’ve let Sheldon come.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Sheldon,"This is interesting. Apparently, a key component in some forms of humour is the element of surprise."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Amy,"Well, that makes sense. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for planning and anticipation, and patients with brain lesions on their…"
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Sheldon,BRAIN LESIONS!
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Amy,"Sheldon, you scared me. That wasn’t funny."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Sheldon,Or maybe you have a stick up your prefrontal cortex.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Amy,"Okay, the notion that you can read a few books and come up with a definitive theory of comedy is absurd. I mean, humour is a complex neurological…(Sheldon drops his trousers)Okay, that’s pretty good."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Sheldon,Excellent.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The mall.,Stuart,How about her?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The mall.,Raj,No. No pretty girls. The point is to talk to regular people and work our way up to pretty girls.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The mall.,Stuart,Fine. How about that old lady with the walker?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The mall.,Raj,"That depends. On any level, do you think she’s hot?"
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The mall.,Stuart,We’ll find somebody else.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Sheldon,Kumquat?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Amy,I guess.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Sheldon,Ointment?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Amy,Sure.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Now, would you say ointment is more, equal to, or less funny than kumquat?"
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Amy,I don’t think I want to go out with you anymore.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Sheldon,Will you please stop joking around? I’m trying to figure this out.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Amy,"Sheldon, how many words are you gonna go through?"
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Sheldon,All of them.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,You didn’t get your part cut.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Voice on TV,"All right, baby, here’s the deal."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"And you didn’t get your part cut. Yep, bunch of old guys rocking out in a band, all with erectile dysfunction, you didn’t get your part cut!"
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,Hey. Can we talk?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"We can, but the part of Penny might get cut."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"That was really crappy of me. What you’re trying to do is hard, but people do make it, and I really do believe you could be one of them."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,Thank you.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"And to show you how much I believe in you, I kind of got you an audition."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,Are you serious? For what?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,The new Star Wars movie.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,What? How did you manage that?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"There’s this thing online, you put yourself on tape and just send it in, anyone can do it."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Come on Leonard, this is just a PR stunt."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"So? Even if it is, you have a huge advantage because you’re an actual actress. Most of the people doing this are just weirdoes and nerds. Wolowitz sent his in two days ago."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Really, let it go."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"Look, maybe it is a long shot, but sometimes long shots happen. Luke Skywalker was only given one chance to destroy the Death Star. He had to get a torpedo into an exhaust port that was only two meters wide, but with the help of The Force, he… wow, I can feel you hating me right now."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The mall.,Stuart,"How about that lady in the sweat suit, speed-walking?"
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The mall.,Raj,"Yeah, she seems friendly and easy to… never mind, she’s gone. You know, maybe talking to people is too hard."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The mall.,Stuart,"We could go over to that department store, practice on the mannequins."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The mall.,Raj,"I don’t know. They’re dressed very stylishly. They’re probably stuck-up. This is ridiculous. The next person that walks by, no matter who it is, they’re the one. We’re gonna die here."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The Cheesecake Factory.,Amy,Hello.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The Cheesecake Factory.,Bernadette,Hey.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The Cheesecake Factory.,Howard,Where’s Sheldon?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The Cheesecake Factory.,Amy,He’s home trying to use science to determine the basis of humour.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The Cheesecake Factory.,Bernadette,That’s interesting.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The Cheesecake Factory.,Amy,"It’s exhausting. Do you have any idea how hard it is to laugh at a knock-knock joke that starts with knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy?"
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The Cheesecake Factory.,Bernadette,"If you want him to stop, sometimes the easiest thing to do is just fake a laugh."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The Cheesecake Factory.,Howard,Fake a laugh? Do you ever do that with me?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The Cheesecake Factory.,Bernadette,"No, of course not."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The Cheesecake Factory.,Howard,"Well, I’d be able to tell anyway."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The Cheesecake Factory.,Bernadette,I don’t think you would.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The Cheesecake Factory.,Howard,"Please, I’ve made plenty of girls laugh, sometimes just by asking them out.(Bernadette laughs uncontrollably)Yeah? Well, I fake my orgasms."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Leonard(on phone),"Yes, how much for a hundred long-stemmed red roses? Really? How much for three?"
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Penny,Hey.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Leonard,"Yeah, I’ll call you back."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Penny,"Look, I know you were just trying to help with your Star Wars thing. I didn’t mean to call it idiotic."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Leonard,"Well, I don’t think you called it idiotic."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Penny,"Oh. Sorry, I meant to. Anyway, um, I was just upset with myself. I wasn’t mad at you. I just feel like everything is falling apart."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Leonard,Come on. It’s okay.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Penny,"No, it’s not okay. Look at me, okay? I took a temp job as a waitress forever ago, and I’m still doing it. I can’t quit, because guess what? I can’t do anything else. And I finally get my big break, and it goes away. I’m such a mess."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Leonard,"No, you’re not."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Penny,"Really? ‘Cause this morning at Starbucks, a pair of old underwear fell out of my pant leg. And it wasn’t the only one in there."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Leonard,"Okay, listen to me, this is just a minor setback."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Penny,"No, it’s not, okay? I’ve been out here for, like, ten years. I’ve nothing to show for it."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Leonard,"Well, you have me."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Penny,You’re right. I do have you. Mm. Let’s get married.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Leonard,What?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Penny,"Ooh. Leonard Hofstadter, will you marry me?"
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Leonard,Um…
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Penny,Did you seriously just say um?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Leonard,"Look, you know I love you but, but you’re, you’re drunk and sad and feeling lost."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Penny,"Okay, so, so you don’t want to marry me?"
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Leonard,That is not what I said.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Penny,"No, forget it. I take it back. Offer’s off the table."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Sheldon,Who’s in the mood to laugh?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Leonard,Really not a good time.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Sheldon,But I used science to construct the perfect joke.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Penny,I’m gonna go.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Leonard,"Penny, don’t."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Penny,"No, no, I just need to be alone."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Sheldon,"So, a sandwich, a rabbi and yo mama walk into a bar. Where are you going?"
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Leonard,To my room.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Sheldon,Should I follow you?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Leonard,No.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Leonard, wait."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Leonard,What?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Sheldon,I forgot to tell you the sandwich is promiscuous.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The mall.,Stuart,How about those guys on that bench over there? They look pathetic. I bet we could talk to them.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The mall.,Raj,That’s a mirror.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The mall.,Stuart,"Oh, yeah."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The mall.,Security Guard,"Hey, fellas, mall’s closing."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The mall.,Raj,Sorry.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The mall.,Security Guard,Yeah. Good night.

Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Sheldon,Would you like to talk about it?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Leonard,"Penny proposed, and I didn’t say yes."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Sheldon,Why not?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Leonard,That’s a good question.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Sheldon,Does that mean the relationship is over?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Leonard,I don’t know.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Sheldon,Why don’t you ask her?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Leonard,Because I’m afraid to know the answer.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, I’m sorry."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Leonard,That’s it? You’re not gonna make some dumb joke or some inappropriate comment?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Sheldon,"No. You’re my friend, and, I’m sorry."
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Leonard,Did you just put a kick me sign on my back?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,The apartment.,Sheldon,No. That wouldn’t be funny at all.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,"Star Wars audition, take one, starring Howard Joel Wolowitz, real-life astronaut. Vader is here, now, on this moon. I felt his presence. He’s come for me. He can feel when I’m near…"
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,How many times do I have to tell you to replace the toilet paper when it’s empty?
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,I’m in the middle of something.
Series 07,Episode 12,The Hesitation Ramification,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,So am I.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Sheldon,It’s an outrage.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Leonard,I know.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"The university, they think they can do whatever they want. We just have to sit there and take it."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Leonard,"You need to let it go, Sheldon."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"You work tirelessly for someone, and this is what you get."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Oh, my God, they’re just making you use your vacation days."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Sheldon,But I don’t want a vacation.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Okay, listen, I don’t mean to diminish what you’re going through, but I’m a little distracted right now."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Oh, this again? So, Penny proposed, you didn’t say yes, and now you think you may have lost her love forever. How does this compare to me being forced to relax for a few days?"
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Leonard,It doesn’t.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Sheldon,Thank you.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Leonard,I’m gonna go talk to Penny.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"I’m going to go inside, put on my coziest pajamas, curl up with a good book and wait for this nightmare to be over."

Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Penny,Yeah. Come in.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Look, if you want to break up, just say it."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Penny,Leonard…
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Leonard,"No, no, no, no. I take it back. Don’t say it. Just, just hate me, but stay with me. It worked for my parents."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Penny,"Listen, I don’t want to break up with you."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Oh. Oh, okay. Good, good. So, it’s cool if I cry a little?"
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Penny,"Yeah, I probably wouldn’t."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Leonard,Yeah.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Penny,"Look, you did the right thing last night. I was a mess. I was just frustrated because my career is going nowhere."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Look, I get it, and I want you to know that I support whatever you want to do."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Penny,"Great, because I’ve been thinking, if I really want this acting thing to work, I need to focus all my energy on it. And to do that, I should quit waitressing at The Cheesecake Factory."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Wow. That, that’s a big step."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Penny,I know.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Leonard,"So, well, before making any rash…"
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Penny,I already quit.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Leonard,And I support you.

Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The apartment.,Sheldon,Please. What if there’s a big breakthrough in science today and I’m not there to see it?
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The apartment.,Leonard,Do you really think there’s gonna be a breakthrough without you there to do it?
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The apartment.,Sheldon,No. I was just tricking you.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The apartment.,Leonard,Bye.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Leonard, wait. Take me with you."

Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The apartment.,Leonard,I said stay. I’m going to work. Do not follow me.

Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The comic book store.,Stuart,Hey.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The comic book store.,Bernadette,Sorry. Did I startle you?
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The comic book store.,Stuart,"Yes, but at this point, pretty much any customer does. What can I do for you?"
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The comic book store.,Bernadette,"Well, I need a little help. I accidentally destroyed one of Howard’s comic books this morning, and was hoping I could replace it."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The comic book store.,Stuart,Wow. What happened?
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The comic book store.,Bernadette,Batman got his ass kicked by my curling iron.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The comic book store.,Stuart,"Well, don’t let The Riddler know that. It’s a comic book joke. Or maybe it’s not."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The comic book store.,Bernadette,Do you have this one?
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The comic book store.,Stuart,"Uh, well, it’s, it’s pretty rare. Can you give me a few days to track it down?"
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The comic book store.,Bernadette,"Ooh, I was kind of hoping to get it before Howie comes home from work."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The comic book store.,Stuart,Oh. What’s the hurry?
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The comic book store.,Bernadette,"Well, he’s always saying I should be more careful with my curling iron, and it seems like a dangerous precedent to let him think he can be right."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The comic book store.,Stuart,"Well, I’ll do what I can, but I can’t make any promises."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The comic book store.,Bernadette,"You know, I do work at a pharmaceutical company. If you can make this happen today, I can hook you up with anxiety medication, antidepressants."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The comic book store.,Stuart,Really? Do you have any of these?
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Amy,"Hello, Mr. Rat Brain. Not so bitey without the rest of the rat to back us up now, are we?"
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Howard,Anybody home?
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Amy,"Hey, what brings you guys here?"
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Raj,"Well, we were just on our way to lunch and wanted to see if you’d like to join."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Amy,"Why? Because Sheldon’s not here this week, and you don’t think I have any other options? I’m just kidding. I’ll get my purse."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Bert,"Hi, Amy. I, oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t know you had any company."

Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Amy,This is so pretty. Bert works for the geology department.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Bert,"Yeah. You know what, uh, geologists and Bon Jovi have in common?"
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Howard,You’re both into rock?
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Bert,"Yeah. Well, see ya."

Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Amy,"What?! No, he doesn’t."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Raj,He brought you a pretty rock.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Amy,So? He does that every day. Oh.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Howard,"You know, if you’d rather skip lunch and hang out with your boyfriend Bert, it’s totally okay."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Amy,He’s not my boyfriend.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Raj,"Are you sure? He’s tall, pale and awkward. That sounds like your type."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Amy,Should someone as lonely as you really be making fun of me?
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Raj,"Yeah, grow up, Howard. God."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Amy,What do I do? I don’t want to hurt his feelings.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Howard,Maybe the problem is he thinks you’re available. Does he know you’re dating Sheldon?
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Amy,I guess it hasn’t come up.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Howard,There you go.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Raj,And does Sheldon know you’re dating Sheldon?

Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Sheldon,Where are you going?
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Penny,"Oh, I have a ton of errands to run. I need to make copies of my headshot, send them off to agents and sign up for a new acting class."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Well, have fun."

Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The comic book store.,Stuart,"No, it’s not. I hate that place. Guy who owns it is a jerk. He’s always making me feel bad about myself."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The comic book store.,Bernadette,"Oh, that’s terrible. What’s the address?"
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The comic book store.,Stuart,"You know, why don’t I just take you there? That way, I can make sure he doesn’t rip you off."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The comic book store.,Bernadette,"Oh, thanks, but I don’twant you to close up. I mean, won’t you lose business? Sorry. That was mean."

Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The cafeteria.,Howard,"So, what is she doing today?"
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"I don’t know. She already thinks I don’t support this, so if I call, it might look like I’m checking up on her."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The cafeteria.,Raj,"Well, do you support this?"
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The cafeteria.,Leonard,Of course I do. She’s a great actress. I’m proud she’s taking this risk.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The cafeteria.,Amy,That’s nice.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The cafeteria.,Leonard,You bought that? Great. I got to call her before I forget how I said it. Hey.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The cafeteria.,Penny,Hi. What’s up?
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"Oh, how’s it going? You taking Hollywood by storm?"
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The cafeteria.,Penny,"Actually, I’m at The Cheesecake Factory."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"You got your job back. That is great news. I didn’t want to say anything, but you are making the right choice. To plunge yourself into debt right now would be literally insane."

Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The cafeteria.,Leonard,And I support you.

Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Penny’s car.,Voice,"Now, take a deep, relaxing breath in through your nose. And let it out."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Penny’s car.,Sheldon,Wow. Didn’t see that coming.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Penny’s car.,Voice,In.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Penny’s car.,Sheldon,Let me guess.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Penny’s car.,Voice,And out.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Penny’s car.,Sheldon,What was I gonna do? Two ins in a row? Where’s my lemonade?
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Penny’s car.,Penny,I didn’t get it.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Penny’s car.,Sheldon,"A fitting swan song to your career as a waitress, to forget my order one last time."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Penny’s car.,Penny,Do you think quitting my job was a mistake?

Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Penny’s car.,Penny,No. I’m serious.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Penny’s car.,Sheldon,Why do you ask?
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Penny’s car.,Penny,Because Leonard just pissed me off. Am I being an idiot or not?
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Penny’s car.,Sheldon,"No, I don’t think you are."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Penny’s car.,Penny,Really?
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Penny’s car.,Sheldon,"The best way to achieve a goal is to devote 100% of your time and energy to it. When I decided I was going to be a physicist, I didn’t take some other job in case it didn’t work out. Which wasn’t easy because there was a lot of pressure from Ms. Pearson for me to be chalk monitor that year."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Penny’s car.,Penny,Thank you. I needed to hear that. Why can’t Leonard understand it?
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Penny’s car.,Sheldon,"Because he’s not like us, Penny. We’re dreamers."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Penny’s car.,Penny,"Yeah, I need to start cracking the window when I leave you in the car."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Bert,Hey.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Amy,"Hello, Bert."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Bert,"So, anyway, there’s this big, uh, rock and mineral show next week in Santa Monica."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Amy,"Listen, um, Bert, before you say anything else, I, I have a boyfriend."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Bert,Oh. This is awkward. You thought I was gonna ask you to go with me to the mineral show.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Amy,Weren’t you?
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Bert,Yeah.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Amy,"That’s very nice of you, but I do have a boyfriend."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Bert,That’s what you all say. You just don’t want to go out with me because I have an off-putting personality.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Amy,"No, that’s not true. My boyfriend has an off-putting personality, too. Like, way worse than you."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Bert,"Don’t worry. I’m used to it. I mean, I’m big and weird and funny-looking and no one ever wants to do anything with me."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Amy,Don’t say that.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Bert,It’s okay. I know I’m a monster.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Amy,"No, Bert, come on. I’d love to go to the mineral show with you."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Bert,Sweet. It’s a date.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Amy,"No, it’s not."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Bert,Too late.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Capital Comics.,Bernadette,Wow.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Capital Comics.,Stuart,Yeah. Haven’t seen this many people in my store since that Korean church bus crashed through my front window.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Capital Comics.,Jesse,"Hey, Stuart."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Capital Comics.,Stuart,Jesse.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Capital Comics.,Jesse,Haven’t seen you in forever. Look how grey you’ve gotten.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Capital Comics.,Stuart,My hair’s exactly the same colour as always.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Capital Comics.,Jesse,"No, I was talking about your skin."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Capital Comics.,Stuart,"Look, uh, my friend here needs a comic book."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Capital Comics.,Jesse,"Ooh, and she went into your store by mistake. Good thing there was no one there to see you. What do you need? Oh, yeah, yeah. I got this. Right over here."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Capital Comics.,Stuart,"Even you, Sweatpants?"
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Capital Comics.,Sweatpants,Free popcorn.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Capital Comics.,Jesse,Can I offer you a coffee? Espresso? Latte?
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Capital Comics.,Bernadette,"No, thanks."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Capital Comics.,Jesse,"How about you, Stu? Mocha? Scone? Directions to the nearest soup kitchen?"
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Capital Comics.,Bernadette,Hey.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Capital Comics.,Jesse,I’m just kidding. He knows where the soup kitchen is.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Capital Comics.,Stuart,It’s on Merton Avenue.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Capital Comics.,Bernadette,I don’t think I like the way you’re treating my friend.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Capital Comics.,Jesse,Sorry. You want the book or not?

Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Capital Comics.,Stuart,"You know something, Jesse? You may have a successful business and the kind of pink complexion that comes with good nutrition, but I have something more important."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Capital Comics.,Jesse,What’s that?
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Capital Comics.,Stuart,Friendship. Which I would trade in a heartbeat for all of this.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Howard,The mineral and rock show? That would be awful even without Bert.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Amy,So what am I supposed to do now?
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Raj,Prepare your uterus for his gigantic offspring?
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Amy,"This isn’t funny. I’m gonna have to tell him the truth, that even if I didn’t have a boyfriend, I wouldn’t be interested in him."

Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Howard,Poor Bert. That guy’s got a rough afternoon ahead of him.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Amy,"Well, how would you want a girl to tell you she wasn’t interested?"
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Raj,"I guess, uh, I’d like her to sit me down, look me in the eye and say, I was wrong. I love you. And then maybe she could touch me in a special way."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Howard,That’s how you reject a guy.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Amy,"Okay, I don’t have time for this. I’m just gonna go find him and be brutally honest."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Howard,"No, don’t."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Raj,He’ll be so upset. He’ll probably climb up the Empire State Building and start swatting at planes.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Howard,You want us to talk to him?
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Amy’s laboratory.,Amy,Really? You would do that?

Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga.,Sheldon,I’ve read that there are great yogis who have such mastery over their bodies they can draw water in through their genitals.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga.,Penny,"Yeah, well, I don’t think we’re gonna get to do that today."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga.,Sheldon,Too bad. It seems like a good way to drink a milk shake without getting brain freeze.

Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga.,Sheldon,"Well, to be honest, I thought she said Yoda."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga.,Penny,"I’m helping him relax because, unlike you, he supports me."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga.,Leonard,"Oh, how many times do I have to say it? I support you."

Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga.,Leonard,"Fine. I’m not sure you should have quit. But if you care so much what I think, why didn’t you ask me before you did it?"
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga.,Penny,"Oh, so now I need your permission? Would you have asked me before you quit your job?"
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga.,Leonard,"Yes. I thought we were in the kind of relationship where we make decisions together. If I’m wrong, then maybe we need to talk about the kind of relationship we’re actually in."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga.,Penny,"Yeah, well, maybe we do."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga.,Sheldon,I’m willing to if you guys are.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga.,Leonard,Can we please have some privacy?
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga.,Sheldon,"Y, No. I’m as much a part of this relationship as you two, and I think it’s high time we put all our cards on the table. For example, where is this going? Are you two ever getting married? And, if so, where will we all live? Have you thought about that?"
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga.,Leonard,No.

Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga.,Penny,"Look, I know you think I’m being reckless, and you might be right, but I need to take this shot."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga.,Sheldon,"Yeah, no kidding. Despite what it says on her résumé, she is no longer 22."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga.,Leonard,"I swear, I am on your side."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga.,Penny,"You keep saying you’re on my side, but you don’t act like it."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga.,Sheldon,"He does that to me, too. Why do we put up with it?"
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga.,Leonard,"Listen, I could never do what you’re doing, okay? I would be terrified."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga.,Penny,"Well, it’s scary for me, too."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga.,Sheldon,I’m fine with it.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga.,Leonard,"My point is, just because I couldn’t do it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t. And I’m proud of you."
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga.,Penny,Okay. Thank you.
Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga.,Sheldon,"Well, to celebrate this reconciliation, let’s all share a milk shake. Uh, Penny, you’ll need a straw."

Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Capital Comics.,Bernadette,"Yes, I am, there’s a few more things I want to say to you. Stuart’s store is just fine, and he’s a much nicer person than you are, and if you still have that comic, I’d like to buy it right now."

Series 07,Episode 13,The Occupation Recalibration,Capital Comics.,Bernadette,"No, I don’t want a latte. I want a cappuccino and a blueberry scone."

Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,"The same, shortly after.",Leonard,Sunday’s gone.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,"The same, shortly after.",Sheldon,"Not Sunday, I love Sunday."

Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,"The same, shortly after.",Penny,"Oh, guys, this is really sad. And in a different way than it was twenty minutes ago."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,"The same, shortly after.",Sheldon,I can’t believe we wasted all that time on our Hulk costumes.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,"The same, shortly after.",Penny,What? You were all going as the Hulk?

Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Gentlemen, I have the solution to our Comic-Con problem. We don’t need them. I’m starting my own convention."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"Sheldon, just buy scalped tickets with us."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"I told you. Buying scalped tickets is against the rules. If you get caught, you get banned from Comic-Con for life. Life, Leonard. You’re gonna feel pretty silly when we’re 80 years old, and you have to drive me down there and then wait in the car for three days."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The cafeteria.,Leonard,Do what you want. We’re getting scalped tickets.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The cafeteria.,Howard,I already found a guy online who’s willing to sell.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,How do you know this isn’t a sting operation set up by the Comic-Con police?
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The cafeteria.,Leonard,The same way I know that the people in the TV set can’t see me.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The cafeteria.,Howard,"Sheldon, just come with us. You’re not gonna make your own convention."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"You know, there was a time when Comic-Con didn’t exist at all until one lone dreamer with a unique vision made it happen. And you mark my words, I’m gonna rip that guy off."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Sheldon(on phone),"Yes, I’m starting my own comic book convention, and I thought that your client, Robert Downey Jr., would be perfect to appear on our first panel. Oh, well, now, why are you saying no? You haven’t even asked him yet. You know, excuse me, but I sat through Iron Man 2. I believe he owes me two hours of his time. They hung up on me."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,"Did you tell them that you’re holding your convention at a Marie Callender’s, and that every panellist gets a free slice of pie?"
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Sheldon,I didn’t even get to that part.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,"Look, even your friend Wil Wheaton thinks this is a waste of time."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Not true. Wil thinks this is a great idea. He was just concerned that he wasn’t a big enough celebrity to headline such an amazing event. Also, that’s the same day that he shampoos his beard."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,"Sheldon, buddy, I just don’t think this is going to come together for you."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Sheldon,You don’t know that. I still have plenty of solid leads on this list.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,Good luck.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Sheldon,"No, wait. I need you to call Stan Lee, Leonard Nimoy and Bill Nye the Science Guy, ’cause, legally, I’m not allowed to. Oh, and, also, Carrie Fisher, you know, ’cause I hear he can be pretty nuts."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,I can’t believe Leonard is spending hundreds of dollars on scalped tickets.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,Penny’s apartment.,Amy,"Last week, you spent that on a little dress."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Yeah, but those tickets only get him into Comic-Con. That dress gets me into anywhere I want."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,Those tickets were pretty expensive. I had to give Howie an advance on his allowance. Now he’s never gonna put his toys away.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,Penny’s apartment.,Amy,"Why can’t they do something sensible like Sheldon and start their own comic book convention? Also, who wants to throw me out that window?"
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,"Well, while they’re acting like teenagers, we could do something grown-up."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,Penny’s apartment.,Amy,Oh. You mean like a museum?
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Yes, like a museum, but anything else."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,"Oh, I know. There’s a nice hotel not far from here where they do afternoon tea."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,Penny’s apartment.,Amy,"Ooh, afternoon tea, how sophisticated of us."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Oh, all right, if we’re gonna be fancy, I should probably put on clean underwear."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,"La-dee-da, look who has clean underwear."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"No, we’re gonna stop at Target on the way."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Raj,"Hey, since Sheldon’s not going to Comic-Con, maybe we could find a cool trio to dress up as."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,"Mmm, what if we go as The Fantastic Four, and just tell people that the Invisible Girl is standing there with us."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Howard,"Oh, and I thought our days of pretending to be with women who don’t exist were over."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Gentlemen, I am one step away from securing a huge guest for my convention."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,Does that step include chloroform and a roll of duct tape?
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Sheldon,"I don’t think that will be necessary for Mr. James Earl Jones. You heard me. The voice of Darth Vader, the Lion King’s dad, and FYI, the guy who says, This is CNN. Which also sounds like Darth Vader."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Raj,How are you gonna get James Earl Jones?
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Simple. Earlier today, he tweeted that he’s looking forward to going to his favourite sushi restaurant for dinner. I googled an interview from four years ago which was conducted in his favourite sushi restaurant. That’s where he’ll be, and that’s where I’m going, and…"
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Howard,And that’s where Darth Vader’s gonna pour soy sauce on your head.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,"Sheldon, I don’t care if you get scalped tickets with us or not, but please don’t be creepy and go stalking this poor guy. You’re gonna get in trouble."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Sheldon,"You’re the ones who are going to get in trouble. You’re buying non-transferable tickets. And from a stranger, no less. Not only can you get banned from Comic-Con, if caught, you could be charged with petty theft. You think about that while I’m warning James Earl Jones about the danger of posting his location on Twitter. He got lucky this time. There are some weirdoes out there.(To the Imperial March theme)Bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. Bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. Bom, bom, badala, baba, badalum, bom, badala, bom, bom, forgot my keys, bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum…"
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,"The same, later.",Howard(on phone),"Okay, great. Bye. Our friendly neighbourhood scalper says he’s running late."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,"The same, later.",Raj,Does he sound like a criminal?
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,"The same, later.",Howard,What do you mean?
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,"The same, later.",Raj,"You know, did he say things like, youse guys, or, listen here, see?"
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,"The same, later.",Leonard,"Yes. He, he’s late because he’s on his way here from 1940."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,"The same, later.",Raj,"I’m just saying, we don’t know who this guy is. What if he wants to steal our money or our kidneys, or make a suit outof our skins?"
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,"The same, later.",Howard,Why would someone want to make clothes out of your skin?
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,"The same, later.",Raj,I don’t know. Maybe ’cause dark doesn’t show the stains?
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,"The same, later.",Leonard,"Well, now you’re making me wonder if we should have met him at a neutral location."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,"The same, later.",Howard,Why do you think I told him to come to your place?
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,Hotel tea room.,Amy,There sure are a lot of little kids here.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,Hotel tea room.,Penny,I can’t believe we thought this would makes us feel grown up.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,Hotel tea room.,Bernadette,I can’t believe the waiter thought I was your daughter.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,Hotel tea room.,Amy,"Well, last time I got dressed up and had tea was when I was five. Just me, my teddy bear, Raggedy Ann and my hamster."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,Hotel tea room.,Bernadette,That’s cute.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,Hotel tea room.,Amy,It was. Till my hamster ate all her babies. It got less cute really fast.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,Hotel tea room.,Bernadette,Should we leave?
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,Hotel tea room.,Penny,"Well, there’s a bar in the lobby."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,Hotel tea room.,Bernadette,I could go for a drink.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,Hotel tea room.,Amy,"Aw. Drinking in the afternoon, just like her mommy."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,A sushi restaurant.,James Earl Jones,"Let me guess. You like Star Wars. You know, I’ve been in other movies. But you don’t care about those, do you? I have one thing to say to people like you. I like Star Wars, too. Care to join me?"
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,A sushi restaurant.,Sheldon,"Thank you. My friend Leonard said if I bothered you while you were eating, you’d think I was a creepy stalker."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,A sushi restaurant.,James Earl Jones,"Well, your friend Leonard sounds like a real weenie."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,A sushi restaurant.,Sheldon,"He is, Mr. Earl Jones, he is."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Raj,"Okay, so, I’m on a Comic-Con message board, and there’s a post from a guy where he says he got caught using someone else’s badge, and Sheldon was right, he did get charged with petty theft. Guys, if I go to jail dressed as the Human Torch, that might send the wrong message."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,Maybe this isn’t a good idea.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Howard,I can text the guy and tell him we changed our minds.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Raj,Do it.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Howard,Okay. We’re officially not going to Comic-Con.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,Hold on. We always do this.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Howard,Do what?
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,"Chicken out. We’re, we’re so afraid of getting into trouble that we never do anything wrong."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Raj,That’s ’cause we’re the good guys.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,Even Batman breaks the rules.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Raj,You know I struggle with Batman.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,"I say, this one time, instead of wimping out, let’s be badasses."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Raj,"Okay, I’ll be a badass, but only if you pinky-swear to be one, too."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,"Howard, you in on this?"
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Howard,No need. I’m breaking rules all the time.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,Name one.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Howard,Last night. Drank my Pepto straight out of the bottle.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Raj,What about that little cup they give you?
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Howard,Yeah. What about it?
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Raj,Are you impressed by that?
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,A little.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Raj,"Yeah, me, too."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The sushi restaurant.,James,"You know, when I first read the script for Empire Strikes Back and Darth Vader told Luke he was his father, I thought for sure he was lying."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The sushi restaurant.,Sheldon,"Me, too. But he wasn’t, was he?"
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The sushi restaurant.,James,He was not. How messed up was that?
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The sushi restaurant.,Sheldon,So messed up.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The sushi restaurant.,James,"What do you say let’s go have some fun? My wife’s in New York, and I got a Lion King residual cheque burning a hole in my pocket."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The hotel bar.,Penny,"So, afternoon tea was a bust."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The hotel bar.,Amy,"On the bright side, every six-year-old there was jealous of my tiara. Not gonna lie, it felt good."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The hotel bar.,Penny,"Let me ask you a question, when did you guys start feeling grown up? ‘Cause I am not sure I do."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The hotel bar.,Bernadette,"Honestly, I thought when I got married I would, but I still kind of feel like I’m pretending. It doesn’t help that most of my clothes come from Gap Kids."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The hotel bar.,Penny,"Okay, so I’m an adult, and the other day I saw an old man slip and fall down, and I laughed. I mean, I laughed hard. Like, like, out loud. If he was conscious, he would’ve heard me."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The hotel bar.,Amy,Gosh.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The hotel bar.,Penny,"I know. One of the tennis balls came off his walker and bounced right off his head. I mean, I, I almost wet myself. I guess you had to be there."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The hotel bar.,Amy,I think I have you both beat. Imagine trying to feel like a grown-up when you’ve never even been with a man.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The hotel bar.,Penny,"Okay, sex is not what makes you a grown-up."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The hotel bar.,Bernadette,Yeah. Or you’d be the oldest one here.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The hotel bar.,Penny,Really? Is that how you talk to your mother?
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Howard,He just parked. He’s on his way up.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,Good. This is exciting.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Raj,It is. I feel alive.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,"Yeah. What if we do get caught, who cares? So we get banned from Comic-Con."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Raj,Maybe slapped with a fine.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Howard,"Oh, no. I’d be an astronaut and a bad boy, how will women keep their pants on?"
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Raj,"Uh, maybe it’ll come up when I apply for citizenship. Oh, crap, what if it comes up when I apply for citizenship?"
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,I wonder if we’d have to disclose something like this when we apply for grants.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Raj,"He’s gonna be here any second, what should we do?"
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Howard,"Okay, you guys are such babies. I’ll handle this. If he thinks we’re not home, he’ll go away."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Raj,I thought you were a badass.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment.,Howard,"I lied about the Pepto, I always use the little cup."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,An ice cream parlour.,Sheldon,"Is it true, as a child, you were a stutterer and were functionally mute for eight years?"
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,An ice cream parlour.,James,It is true.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,An ice cream parlour.,Sheldon,Oh. Is it true they used scuba gear to create the sound of Darth Vader breathing?
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,An ice cream parlour.,James,They sure did.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,An ice cream parlour.,Sheldon,Oh. Is it true that you were pre-med in college and you almost became a doctor?
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,An ice cream parlour.,James,That’s right.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,An ice cream parlour.,Sheldon,"Oh, James, I could listen to your stories all night."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The hotel bar.,Penny,"I mean, really, what’s so great about being grown up?"
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The hotel bar.,Bernadette,"Well, for starters, we’d be splitting this check three ways."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The hotel bar.,Penny,"I’m serious. Who wants to do all that stuff? Have insurance, pay mortgages, leave one of those little notes when you hit a parked car."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The hotel bar.,Amy,I told you it was Penny.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The hotel bar.,Penny,"Oh, come on, it wasn’t me. Anyone could have knocked your mirror off, or whatever happened."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The hotel bar.,Amy,"Maybe the guys are right. I mean, we spent the whole night trying to be mature, and it was kind of boring. I’m sure they’re having more fun than we are."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,The apartment. Banging on door.,Howard,"Oh, God, I could really use exactly two tablespoons of Pepto right now."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,A big wheel.,Sheldon,"Hey, Los Angeles. I’m on a Ferris Wheel with Darth Vader. And he’s nicer than you think."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,A big wheel.,James,I am.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,A karaoke bar.,Sheldon,"In the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion sleeps tonight…"
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,A karaoke bar.,James,"Ah-wimoweh, ah-wimoweh…"
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,A karaoke bar.,Sheldon,"Bring it home, Mufasa. Eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, um, um-a-weh."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,A karaoke bar.,James,"Ah-wimoweh, ah-wimoweh…"
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,A karaoke bar.,Sceme,Outside a house.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,A karaoke bar.,Sheldon,I don’t understand what we’re doing.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,A karaoke bar.,James,Shh.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,A karaoke bar.,Sheldon,Whose house is this?
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,A karaoke bar.,James,"Carrie Fisher. And she’s a little crazy, so get ready to run.(Rings doorbell)"
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,A karaoke bar.,Carrie Fisher,"It’s not funny anymore, James."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,A karaoke bar.,James,Then why am I laughing?
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,A sauna.,James,"Ah, Sheldon, this is the perfect end to a perfect night."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,A sauna.,Sheldon,Okay. But I think it could have ended with the karaoke.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,A sauna.,James,What were you trying to ask me at the strip club?
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,A sauna.,Sheldon,Oh. How much does it cost to get them off my lap?
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,A sauna.,James,No. Something about a convention.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,A sauna.,Sheldon,"Oh, right. Well, my friends and I couldn’t get into Comic-Con this year, and I was trying to start my own convention, and I was going to ask if you would be a panelist."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,A sauna.,James,Why don’t you and your friends come to Comic-Con with me?
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,A sauna.,Sheldon,Really?
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,A sauna.,James,"Of course. And San Diego is right across the border from my favorite city on Earth, Tijuana, where I’m taking you every night."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,A sauna.,Sheldon,Ay-yi-yi.
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,A sauna.,James,"Ay-yi-yi, bang-bang."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,"The same, later.",James,"So, Beau Bridges is on my shoulders, and Jeff Bridges is on Marlon Brando’s shoulders, and remember, we do not have permission to be in the pool… hey, Sheldon, wake up. And Angie Dickinson is about to sic the dogs on us, and I go under the water and Marlon goes under the water, and the water raises about two feet and sloshes all over her patio, and the dogs freak out and run like hell, and then we run like hell. Oh, boy, that was a lot of fun."
Series 07,Episode 14,The Convention Conundrum,"The same, later.",Sheldon,"I’m sorry, who’s Angie Dickinson?"
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Amy,"Item 28, your pet name for me. Time’s running out on this. You need to make a decision."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,I submitted you a notarised list.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Amy,"I’m sorry, but Gollum and Flakey are not acceptable."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, you don’t like Princess Corncob, you don’t like Fester, you’re just impossible to please."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Amy,"We’ll come back to that one. This brings us to the final item in our annual State of the Relationship Summit. Item 29, Valentine’s Day."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Ah, the worst for last. Hmm. Classic Flakey."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Amy,"Before you get upset, I believe I’ve come up with a way for us to celebrate the occasion that we both can enjoy."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"People usually start a meeting with a joke, but you go ahead, end with one."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Amy,I propose we spend a weekend at a bed-and-breakfast in Napa Valley.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"I hate every word in that sentence. Including in, at, we and a."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Amy,"Come on, Sheldon. Why not?"
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"For starters, a bed-and-breakfast forces you to eat with strangers at your table."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Amy,"One step ahead of you, Bernadette and Wolowitz are going with us."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, very well. What are the sleeping arrangements? We’ve only been dating for three years. If we were to share a room, people might talk."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Amy,I got you your own room.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,What if my room has a claw-foot bathtub?
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Amy,It doesn’t. I know it makes you feel like you’re bathing inside a monster.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Look, I appreciate the effort, but I’m still unclear how this trip is supposed to be enjoyable for me."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Amy,We’re going to have Valentine’s Day dinner on a fully functioning vintage train.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Vintage? Be specific.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Amy,An Alcoa FA-4 diesel locomotive leading a train of meticulously restored 1915 Pullman first-class coaches.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Wow. I’m feeling the urge to hug you. And one, and two, all right, Gollum, we’re good."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,,Credits sequence.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Bernadette,Are you sure you guys don’t want to come with us to Napa? You could probably still get a room.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Penny,"No, I think we’re just gonna have a quiet weekend at home."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Plus, I’m not sure it’s a great idea to take Penny to where wine comes from. What? It’s a joke. Oh, come on. We bust on each other. I wear dorky glasses, you might have a problem, it’s all for laughs."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Penny,That would really piss me off if I didn’t have a buzz going on.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Howard, which pocket watch will you be wearing for dinner on the train?"
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Howard,"I’m sorry, what?"
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, I’m afraid if we wear the same pocket watch, it will be embarrassing."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Howard,I don’t own a pocket watch.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, my. Well, then my apologies for bringing up this sore spot."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Raj,"Since you two are gonna be around for Valentine’s, would you mind watching Cinnamon?"
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Penny,"You have Valentine’s plans? Which came out sounding way more surprised than I meant. Here, let me try that again. You have Valent… See? I can’t do it."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Raj,I don’t have plans which is why I booked time on the big telescope that night.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Amy,"Well, an evening looking at the stars, that’s still kind of romantic."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Raj,Except I’ll be alone.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Amy,I’m trying to put lipstick on a pig here. Work with me.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Leonard,We’d be happy to watch Cinnamon.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Penny,Yeah.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Raj,"Thank you. Oh, and I’d like for at least one of us to see some action, so if you guys happen to have sex, it’s cool if she stays in the room."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Penny,"Hey, same goes for the two of you with Amy."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The Pullman dining car.,Amy,"What do you think, Sheldon?"
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The Pullman dining car.,Sheldon,It’s magnificent. This is going to be the best Valentine’s Day ever.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The Pullman dining car.,Amy,I’m so glad you like it.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The Pullman dining car.,Sheldon,"I’m prepared to say I love it, as soon as I confirm there are no hobos aboard."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Leonard(on phone),"Okay. Raj, I got it. Bye.(To Cinnamon)That was your daddy. He wanted me to say that he misses… Why am I doing this?"
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Penny,Happy Valentine’s Day.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Ooh, flowers and chocolates? Somebody’s trying to get me out of my panties."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Penny,Don’t be surprised if you find five chocolates missing and three gross coconut ones with a bite taken out. It came that way when I bought it.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Got you a little something, too."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Penny,"Aw, jewellery. Oh, my God, Lakers tickets?"
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Leonard,"It gets better. Instead of me, you can take someone who will actually enjoy it."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Penny,Aw. You are the best boyfriend ever.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Thank you. Seriously, please don’t make me go."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Penny,Should we take this little party to the bedroom?
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Mm, don’t have to, we have the whole place to ourselves."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Penny,"Oh, that’s true."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Leonard,"In fact, if you want, we can do it right here on Sheldon’s spot."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Penny,That is the least sexy thing anyone’s ever said to me.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Leonard,To the bedroom.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Penny,Yeah.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Waiter,"And for the entrée, tonight’s special is a seafood risotto. Do you have any questions?"
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Sheldon,"Uh, I do. Uh, does this train car have the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?"
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Waiter,"I’m sorry, I meant questions about the food."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Sheldon,"Oh, of course. Um, is the seafood risotto being served on a train car with the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?"
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Amy,"Uh, I think we’re gonna need a minute."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Man in seat behind,"Fun fact, it’s neither. They actually use the AAR type E coupler. If you listen carefully when the locomotive disconnects, you’ll hear the characteristic click-pshht-thunk of the knuckle."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Sheldon,Get out of town.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Howard,"Fun fact, I’m gonna jump off this train."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Hey, Cinnamon, guess who just did it human style."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Penny,"Oh, my God."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Leonard,"It’s a little late, but I’ll take it."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Penny,"No, Cinnamon ate the chocolates. That’s really bad for dogs."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, crap. What are we gonna do?"
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Penny,We gotta get her to a vet right now.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Leonard,"I don’t have a vet. I have a podiatrist, an optometrist, an allergist, a dermatologist, a urologist. You’d think I’d have a vet."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Penny,Okay. There’s one not far from here. Come on. Let’s go.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Leonard,Okay. Koothrappali was right. We should have let her watch.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Sheldon,"Do another one, do another one."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Man,Okay. Here’s my impression of the Amtrak Acela barreling down the Eastern Corridor. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Sheldon,"It’s like there’s a train in your mouth. Howard: Oh, yeah. I’ve got one. Um, the Amtrak Wolverine coming into Chicago. Bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch, bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch. Ooo-ooo."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Man,I’ve been on that train. And I just was again.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Amy,See if you guys can guess this one. Bang. Splat. Thud.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Sheldon,How many trains have you been on?
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Man,Tons. A box fell on my head at UPS six years ago. Now I just collect disability and ride trains.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Sheldon,Wow. Your life’s amazing.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Man,Not always. A box fell on my head at UPS six years ago. Now I just collect disability and ride trains.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Amy,Why do I even try?
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Bernadette,I’m gonna fix this right now.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Howard,Okay. Just make it look like an accident.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Bernadette,Excuse me. You are at Valentine’s dinner with your girlfriend. Now get back over there and be with her.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Sheldon,You’re right. That was insensitive of me. I have to go back to my table now. You should join us.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Man,All right.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Bernadette,Great. Now there’s two of ’em.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,A vet’s surgery.,Lady Vet,How much chocolate did she eat?
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,A vet’s surgery.,Penny,A whole box.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,A vet’s surgery.,Leonard,"Well, to be fair, you ate a lot of it before you gave it to me."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,A vet’s surgery.,Penny,So the point is I may have saved her life.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,A vet’s surgery.,Vet,"I’m sorry, is this a joke to you?"
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,A vet’s surgery.,Leonard,No. Maybe to her.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,A vet’s surgery.,Vet,How big a box of chocolate was it?
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,A vet’s surgery.,Penny,"Uh, something like this. I don’t know. It came free with a full tank of gas."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,A vet’s surgery.,Leonard,Really? Do you know how much those Lakers tickets were?
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,A vet’s surgery.,Penny,Do you know how much gas is?
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,A vet’s surgery.,Vet,Hey.

Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The vets surgery.,Leonard,"Maybe, but you also think nine minutes isn’t a while, so what do you know?"
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Howard,You okay?
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Amy,Why? Because my boyfriend’s off playing choo-choo with some weirdo?
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Howard,"Well, to be fair, they’re both weirdos."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Amy,I don’t know what made me think tonight would be any different.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Bernadette,"Well, just the fact that you got him up here still says a lot. To be honest, I bet Howie 200"

Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Sheldon,How is that possible? I’ve hardly spoken to you since we got on the train.
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Man,"I’m detecting a little friction between you two, and I don’t want to be a third rail. Get it?"

Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Sheldon,"Oh, really? Because I remember you saying that this trip was going to be something we could both enjoy. Did you mean that, or were you just trying to trick me?"
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Amy,"Fine, it’s true. I deserve romance, and I didn’t know how else to make it happen."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The dining car.,Sheldon,"Well, if you want romance, then let’s have romance. Oh, look, there’s wine. Mmm. Grape juice that burns. Uh, now let’s gaze into each other’s eyes, hmm? You blinked. I win."

Rajesh, I was dreading Valentine’s Day. Thank you for spending it with me. Yvette. Cinnamon, she-she gave me her phone number. If I’d known it was that easy, I would have considered poisoning you months ago. Oh, what should I say? Oh, I know. I’ll point out her name’s Yvette, and that she’s a vet. That’s hysterical. She’ll love it."

Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I’m gonna need more details."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, well, my new friend’s name was Eric. Um, Amy lips tasted like the brownie we had for dessert. Oh, and the banjo-playing conductor was missing a finger, but he made up for it with his can-do attitude."
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Leonard,"No, hang on. Hang on. Are all those things equal to you?"
Series 07,Episode 15,The Locomotive Manipulation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Hmm. It never occurred to me to pick a favourite.

Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Leonard,"Here you are, Mother."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Beverley,Thank you.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Leonard,I’m glad you decided to stay. It’s gonna be special for Penny and me to share this with you.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Beverley,I can’t wait for this day to be over.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Leonard,"Yeah, special, like that.(Knock on door)That’s them. Please don’t make things any more awkward than they already are."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Sheldon,"All right, so less or equally awkward, got it."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Leonard,"Hey, guys, come on in."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Alfred,"Oh, thank you."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Mary,Good morning.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Beverley,Morning.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Sheldon,Hello.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Alfred,How is everyone today?
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Beverley,"Good, and you?"
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Alfred,"Good, good."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Beverley,Good.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Mary,"I’m good, too."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Beverley,Good.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Sheldon,"So, did you defile my mother or not?"
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Mary,Sheldon. You’re being rude.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Alfred,"If I may, I can assure you, your mother and I did nothing more than share a cab and a conversation."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Sheldon,Did that conversation include the phrase your genitals are a joy to behold?
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Mary,That’s enough.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Alfred,"Look, I promise you, neither I, nor anyone, has ever said that."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Leonard,You don’t know his girlfriend very well.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Sheldon,Or what a joy it is to behold my genitals.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"All right, you guys, uh, get settled in, then we’ll go across the hall and say hi to everyone."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Randall,"You know, It’s hard to believe I’ve never met Leonard."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Wyatt,"Well, he probably buys his illegal drugs from a local vendor."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Susan,"Not funny, Wyatt."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,I thought it was really funny.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Wyatt,Thanks.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Susan,"Well, fine, if everyone wants to make jokes about our problems, then I can, too. Knock, knock. Who’s there? Our family is an embarrassment."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Randall,That’s not much of a joke.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Okay. Listen, Mom, I know you’re nervous, but I promise you, no one is gonna judge you or this family."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Susan,"Oh, I’m sorry. It’s just we’re meeting Leonard’s parents for the first time, and, and they’re academics and, and intellectuals, and I don’t want them thinking we’re white trash."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Randall,"Well, what colour trash do you think they’ll believe?"
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Mary,How could you think that I would spend the night with a man I just met?
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Sheldon,A man named Jesus convinced you to build a church in Africa. You’re kind of a sucker.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Leonard,"Well, nothing happened, right? It’s over. Until we get married a third time, you guys will never have to see each other again."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Alfred,"Well, you know, actually that’s not the case. Mary may visit me in New York."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Mary,Mm-hmm. And he’s never been to Texas.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Alfred,Maybe we meet halfway.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Sheldon,What? In the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia? I can’t be the only one that knows that’s halfway.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Beverley,You’re not seriously going to visit each other.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Alfred,And why wouldn’t we?
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Beverley,"Oh please, you’re just saying this to antagonize me."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Alfred,"Oh, not at all. Mary happens to be a wonderful woman. And if it antagonizes you, that’s just a bonus."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Leonard,"Mary, I’m sorry you’re in the middle of this."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Mary,"No, no, nothing to be sorry about. I genuinely like your father."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Sheldon,"What? But he’s a mediocre academic. And according to Beverley, his sexual prowess is sub-par. He’s basically Leonard with a bigger prostate."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Leonard,Are you saying that my dad’s not good enough for your mom?
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Yes, while also getting in a solid dig at you. Pretty efficient, huh?"
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Leonard,This is ridiculous. I’m going across the hall.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Sheldon,But why should you get to go and leave me here with your bickering parents?
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Leonard,"Fine, then you go."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Mary,"Well, I don’t want to stay here with her. I’ll go."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Alfred,I’ll go with you.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Leonard,That still leaves me here with him.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Hang on, hang on. We’re smart, we can figure this out. Okay, so: Mary and Beverley can’t be together. Uh, Alfred and Beverley can’t be together. Leonard and I can’t be together. Now, I could be with Alfred but I don’t like his face. Oh, here. I’ve got it."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Amy,Who’s ready for a wedding?
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Great, now I have to start all over."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Wyatt,So how’s the world of pharmaceuticals treating you?
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,Pretty good. I actually just got assigned a much better territory.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Susan,See what happens when you work hard?
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Randall,"Hey, she just sells drugs. I had to make ’em."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Susan,"Okay, that’s enough. No more drug talk for the rest of this trip."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Wyatt,I’ll drink to that.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Susan,Haven’t you had enough?
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Wyatt,Penny drinks more than I do.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Well, I learned from the best."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Wyatt,Aw.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,Aw.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Susan,"Very nice, Wyatt. And you wonder why this one turned out the way he did."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Randall,You see what I’ve gotta put up with.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Susan,What you’ve gotta put up with? Why did you have to go to jail?
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Randall,"It’s called getting caught, Mother."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,Hello.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Wyatt,"Hey, there he is."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,Hey.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Susan,"Oh, Leonard. It’s so nice to see you again."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, you, too. Hey, everyone, this is my mother, Beverley."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Beverley,Hello.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Susan,Hi.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Randall,We are not white trash.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Amy,Are you excited to see your son walk down the aisle?
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Alfred,"Yes, I am. I’m just feeling a little guilty about all the trouble I’ve caused."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Mary,"Oh, so am I."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Sheldon,"You made God sad today, Mom."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Amy,"Sheldon, they haven’t done anything wrong. I think it’s nice they’re hitting it off."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, that’s still no reason to rush into anything. I mean, look at us. We took things remarkably slow. You and I, we didn’t even hold hands for two years."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Amy,It was a lot hotter than it sounds.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Alfred,You’re a patient young lady.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Hey, hey. She’s mine, take a cold shower, grandpa."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,Why wouldn’t that colonel say what the meeting’s about? It has to be bad news.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"Calm down, okay? Try not to think about it."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,That’s really stupid advice.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,You know that hurts my feelings.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Calm down, try not to think about it."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,Okay.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,Why do I bother talking to you?
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"Oh, come on. What’s the worst that could come of this meeting?"
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"I don’t know. They take the invention away, and I get nothing?"
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"Okay, that’s not so bad. You know what happened to the scientists that worked on the Manhattan Project? The government forced them to move to the desert. They had to live in secret, and when Oppenheimer objected to what they made him do, they destroyed his reputation."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,What’s the point of that story?
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"I just read a book about Oppenheimer, seemed like a chance to show off.(Howard laughs)There he is, there’s my happy Hebraic homeboy. Yeah, that’s the smile I’m gonna remember when you’re living in the desert and I’m living with your wife."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Beverley,"So, what do you do for a living?"
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Randall,"Mommy, you want to take this one?"
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Susan,"Um, Randall’s in between jobs."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Randall,And court appearances.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Wyatt,It’s nice to meet the woman who raised this fine young man. I’m looking forward to meeting his father.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Beverley,Prepare to be disappointed.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Leonard,"And he can’t wait to meet you, too. Can I get anyone a drink?"
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Wyatt,"Well, I could use another beer."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Susan,You’re done. He’s done.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,Hey. Is everyone getting to know each other?
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s apartment.,Randall,Not at all.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Stuart,"Nice to see you again, Dr. Hofstadter. I’m, uh, Leonard’s friend, Stuart."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Beverley,"Nice to see you, too."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Stuart,"Hi, I’m Stuart."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Alfred,"Oh, I’m Alfred. Leonard’s father."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Stuart,"Oh. Oh, hi. Uh, I’m sorry, did you two want to sit together?"
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Together,No.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Stuart,I was wondering why the front row was available.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Bernadette,"Okay, I think we’re ready."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Sheldon,Why do people cry at weddings?
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Mary,They’re practicing for what’s coming later.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Susan,Thank you for cleaning yourself up for your sister’s wedding.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Randall,Thank you for my new teeth.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Wyatt,"Welcome to the family, Leonard. Don’t lend your new brother-in-law money."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Bernadette,We’re here today to celebrate love.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Beverley,Urgh.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Alfred,"Sigh louder, no one heard you."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Stuart,"Really, I can move."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Bernadette,"Not just Leonard and Penny’s love, but the love we have for them, as well as each other."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Sheldon,"Speaking of love, STDs among the elderly are skyrocketing."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Bernadette,"Love is patient, but it’s not gonna put up with all the side chatter, so let’s knock it off."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Howard,At least she’s yelling at someone else for a change.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Bernadette,Howard.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Penny,"Okay, I understand everyone’s a little tense today, so I am just gonna get to the important stuff. Leonard, standing here with you in front of our family and friends is bringing up a lot of feelings. Like what a good idea it was to elope the first time. But also how incredibly happy you make me. Thank you for marrying me. Hopefully for the last time."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Leonard,"Penny, as a scientist, my job is to figure out why things happen. But I don’t think I’ll ever understand how someone like me could get to be with someone like you. You know, maybe I don’t"
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,,"need to understand it, I just need to be grateful. I love you, Penny."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Penny,Oh.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Bernadette,Anybody have anything snarky to say about that? Didn’t think so.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Alfred,"I’d like to say something. Beverly, I know that we don’t bring out the best in each other."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,,But something wonderful did come from our relationship. That young man right there.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Beverley,I couldn’t agree more.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Stuart,That’s beautiful.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Bernadette,"Thank you. All right, let’s continue."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Sheldon,"Yeah, excuse me, I need to say something to someone pretty special, and I just can’t wait any longer."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Amy,It’s happening.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Sheldon,"Leonard, you and I have our ups and downs. But I have always considered you my family. Even before the recent threat of our parents fornicating like wrinkly old rabbits. I don’t always show it, but you are of great importance to me. Both of you."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Penny,Oh.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Leonard,Thank you.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,The wedding ceremony.,Bernadette,Okay. I now pronounce you husband and wife. And weird other husband who came with the apartment.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Leonard’s car.,Beverley,Thank you for taking us to the airport.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Leonard’s car.,Leonard,"Hey, I’m just thrilled we’re all getting along for a minute."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Leonard’s car.,Alfred,"Yeah, me, too. Beverly, I’m sorry if I upset you."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Leonard’s car.,Beverley,"Water under the bridge, Alfred. Leonard, why don’t you get into the carpool lane?"
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Leonard’s car.,Alfred,"Well, that’s a solid line. He can’t cross that."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Leonard’s car.,Leonard,That’s okay. I can make it over.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Leonard’s car.,Beverley,"No, no, let’s plod along. It’ll make your father feel more comfortable."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Leonard’s car.,Alfred,What makes me comfortable is knowing I don’t have to wake up tomorrow morning and see your sour face.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Leonard’s car.,Beverley,"Do the world a favour, and don’t wake up tomorrow morning."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Leonard’s car.,Leonard,That was almost a minute.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Amy’s car.,Mary,There’s a lot of traffic. Are we gonna be okay?
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Amy’s car.,Amy,You’ll be at the airport an hour before your flight.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Amy’s car.,Mary,Good. Thank you.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Amy’s car.,Sheldon,Plenty of time for you to meet another geriatric boy toy.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Amy’s car.,Mary,Hey. I will not have you be disrespectful to me.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Amy’s car.,Sheldon,Yes ma’am.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Amy’s car.,Amy,"Sheldon, you’re mother’s an attractive woman. You need to get use to the fact that men are going to be interested in her."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Amy’s car.,Sheldon,"Well, and you need to drive the car and mind your business."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Amy’s car.,Amy,I will not have you be disrespectful to me.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Amy’s car.,Sheldon,"What, you’re not my mother."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Amy’s car.,Mary,Don’t you be disrespectful to her.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Amy’s car.,Sheldon,Yes ma’am.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Amy’s car.,Mary,You’ll get there. You’ve just gotta put some zing on it.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s car.,Susan,"Penny, I don’t know what I was worried about. You’re friends are just lovely."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s car.,Penny,"Oh, thanks, Mom."
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s car.,Susan,Although that Sheldon is a bit peculiar.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s car.,Penny,Is he? I never noticed.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s car.,Wyatt,He reminds me of that turkey we had who drowned looking up at the rain.
Series 10,Episode 01,The Conjugal Conjecture,Penny’s car.,Randall,"Cops, cops, be cool."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,,,Following a “previously on” sequence.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Sheldon,Look at this. Elon Musk has a theory that we’re all just characters in some advanced civilization’s video game.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Leonard,So some alien kid spent his money on the asthma-and-glasses upgrade for me?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, he doesn’t say it’s a good game."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Howard(entering),"All right, we got a problem."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Leonard,What’s up?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Howard,The Air Force contacted me about our quantum gyroscope. They want to have a meeting.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Leonard,Really?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Raj,Yeah. This military guy showed up at Howard’s door. He was terrifying.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, what did he say?"
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Raj,He gave me his business card and asked me to please pass it along to Howard.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Sheldon,That doesn’t sound terrifying.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Raj,"To a white guy born here, no. If you are a brown guy whose name has a lot of syllables in it, terrifying."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Leonard,"You realize if the military declares our research classified, they can take the whole thing away from us."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Howard,"And if that happens, we’ll never be able to sell it commercially."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Leonard,There goes our big payday.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Howard,I was counting on that money. I need to make as much as my wife so I don’t have to try so hard in bed.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Leonard,"You do that, too?"
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Howard,"Oh, yeah. How do you think I stay this thin?"
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Gentlemen, I think we are losing sight of the real issue. We are on the precipice of becoming faceless cogs in the military-industrial complex. Isn’t that exciting?"
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Raj,"Well, you’re kidding, right?"
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Not at all. In Star Wars, when the stormtroopers would march in perfect formation, harassing civilians, didn’t you ever think, hey, that could be me?"
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Howard,"Sheldon, we could be contributing to a weapons system that oppresses mankind for the next thousand years."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Okay, Howard’s on board. What do you think, Leonard?"
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,,Credits sequence.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,"I’m worried about Howard. Ever since that guy from the Air Force showed up, he’s been a nervous wreck."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"All right, we work at a giant pharmaceutical company. Get him some anti-anxiety meds."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,He won’t take any pills that aren’t chewable and shaped like a Flintstone.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"You know, when Leonard’s feeling anxious I make him take a long walk."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Amy,Does that help?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Well, for a while. Then he comes back."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,I don’t believe this.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Amy,What’s wrong?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,This guy from the office just congratulated me on being pregnant.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Amy,"You did already know, right?"
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,No one at the office did. Did you tell anyone?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,No. You told me not to.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,"I bet it was Barbara Chen in retrovirus. She might have heard me throwing up one morning. Every since she got the hearing aid, she thinks she’s so great."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Amy,Why don’t you want anyone to know?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,"‘Cause I’m up for a major immunotherapy study, and if they find out I’m pregnant they might give it to someone else."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,Would they really do that?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,"I know they would, they did it to Barbara Chen last year when I told everyone she was pregnant."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Raj,Wail till I Snapchat that my friends might be working on a top secret government project.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Leonard,Are you crazy? You can’t put that on Snapchat.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Raj,"Fine, I’ll put it on Facebook like a caveman."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Howard,"You know, maybe before our meeting we should talk to a lawyer."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Leonard,That’s not a bad idea.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Raj,"Well, you must have someone in your family that’s a lawyer."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Howard,"Why? Because I’m Jewish? That’s like me saying, hey, you’re Indian, doesn’t your cousin work in a call centre?"
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Raj,My cousin does work in a call centre.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Howard,And my cousin’s a lawyer.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Sheldon,"We don’t need Howard’s cousin. No, we have me."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Leonard,"You’re not a lawyer, Sheldon, you’re just a know-it-all."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Sheldon,I am not a know-it-all. I’m a person who knows lots of things and likes to correct other people when they’re wrong.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Leonard,That’s the definition of being a know-it-all.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Or in German, a Besserwisser."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,How did you think you were gonna hide your pregnancy?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,I had a plan. I kept leaving Dove Bar wrappers around to explain any weight gain.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Amy,Where did you get empty Dove Bar wrappers?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,"From all the Dove Bars I ate. I’m pregnant. Try to keep up. I’m sorry, I have to go find out if my boss knows."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Amy,"Well, whatever happens, we’re here for you."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,Thanks. You guys are the best.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Yeah, drive safe. We love you. And give us a call… Oh, my God, it was me, it was me. I’m the one who blabbed she was pregnant!"
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Amy,What?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,I didn’t mean to. It just slipped out in front of her assistantone day. I…
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Bernadette,I forgot my coat.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Oh, here’s your coat, honey. That’s such a cute jacket. Oh God, I feel so bad, I just lied to her."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Amy,"Oh, but you did it so well. That’s amazing, it’s like watching a sculptor, but your clay was lies."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,Is that really what’s important right now?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Amy,"I mean, seriously, you have got to let me scan your brain when you’re being dishonest so I can see what lights up."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"That’s super helpful, Amy. Thanks a lot. I can’t wait to do that."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Penny’s apartment.,Amy,I can see a clump of bitch cells lightin’ up from here.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Howard,Give me a second to call my cousin.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Sheldon,I don’t see how a tax lawyer from Fort Lauderdale could be helpful regarding intellectual property.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Howard,"First of all, he’s in Boca Raton, which is better than Fort Lauderdale. But more importantly, he lasted two days on Jeopardy, so he’s clearly a smart guy."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Howard’s cousin(on skype),Hello.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Howard,"Hey, Marty. Thanks for talking to us."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Marty,"Hey, no problem. Thanks for going to outer space so no matter what I do my mom will be disappointed in me."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Howard,"Well, I married a little Catholic girl, so we’re even. Anyway, this is Leonard and Sheldon. The three of us came up with the guidance system."

Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Sheldon,Hello.

Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Raj,"Oh, I’m not on the patent. I’m just here because there’s a bumblebee in my office."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Leonard,I saw it. It’s big.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Howard,"Anyway, like I said in the e-mail, this meeting’s on Thursday. Do you have any advice for us?"
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Marty,"Well, I don’t know much about patent law. But, uh, my advice is hear them out, offer as little information as possible, and whatever you do, don’t sign anything."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Sheldon,"Don’t sign anything? That’s your advice? Okay, so, uh, if during this meeting, one of us were to, say, complete an oil painting, you’d recommend that we leave that unsigned?"
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Marty,That’s not what I meant.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Sheldon,That’s what you said.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Marty,That’s not what I meant.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Sheldon,"This must be how you practice law in Boca Raton, by saying things you don’t mean and meaning things you don’t say."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Marty,"Howard, why is he yelling at me?"
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Sheldon,"All right, you were on Jeopardy. Allow me to Alex Trebek this and put it in the form of a question: Who has been a complete waste of our time?"
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Howard,"Marty, let me call you back."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Leonard,"Someday, when I’m up on murder charges, you’ll be hearing from me."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Sheldon,You don’t need him. I’ll represent you.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Penny,Hi.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Bernadette,Hey. What brings you by?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Penny,"Oh, had to go to a sales seminar on our new sleeping pill."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Bernadette,Oh. How was it?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Penny,Great.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Bernadette,Fell asleep?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Penny,"In, like, two minutes. Yeah. So, how is everything going around here? Are you still upset about people finding out you’re pregnant?"
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Bernadette,I’m furious.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Penny,"Sure, sure. Uh, did you ever figure out who told?"
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Bernadette,"No. I confronted Barbara Chen, but she claimed she didn’t know what I was talking about."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Penny,"Hmm. Well, I guess it’s just gonna remain a mystery, you know, like whatever happened in that seminar after they dimmed the lights."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Bernadette,It had to be Barbara. I’ve been trying to figure out a way to get back at her. Do you think using her work computer to Google how to be a prostitute is over the line?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Penny,"Uh, you know, when I was in high school, there was this girl who was talking about me behind my back, so me and all my friends, we cornered her in the bathroom and forgave her."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Bernadette,What kind of revenge is that? This woman screwed with my job. She’s got to pay.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Penny,"Okay, all right, honey, you know what? There was something I was too scared to tell you yesterday, and now I’m just balls-out terrified to tell you, but the truth is it wasn’t Barbara Chen, it was me. I’m the reason everyone knows."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Bernadette,Why did you do that?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Penny,"Well, it was an accident.I am so sorry I lied."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Bernadette,Get out.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Penny,"Oh, you know, I also lied about the girl in the bathroom. Yeah, we actually dumped her retainer in the toilet and put it back in her mouth."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Sheldon,I don’t understand why I can’t talk at this meeting.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Leonard,"‘Cause when you talk, it enrages people."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Sheldon,Okay. Quick question. Am I allowed to exchange pleasantries upon meeting this colonel?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Leonard,Yes.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Sheldon,Am I allowed to inform him that Colonel Sanders was never actually in the military?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Leonard,I’m getting enraged.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Sheldon,Fine. Ooh. Can I use text-to-speech software?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Howard,No.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Leonard,Don’t speak.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Sheldon’s phone,"Aw, nuts."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Colonel Williams,"Gentlemen, I’m Colonel Williams. Thank you for meeting with me."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Leonard,Hi.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Howard,Hello.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Colonel Williams,"So, which one of you is the brains behind all this?"
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Howard,"It’s a group effort, but I guess if we had to pick a main brain, it would be me."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Sheldon,(Strangled sound)
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,"The same, shortly after, demonstrating the quantum gyroscope.",Colonel Williams,"And because of the quantum vortices, this can run perpetually?"
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,"The same, shortly after, demonstrating the quantum gyroscope.",Leonard,"Exactly. Yeah, you have a good grasp of the physics."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,"The same, shortly after, demonstrating the quantum gyroscope.",Colonel Williams,"Well, I’m a scientist by training."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,"The same, shortly after, demonstrating the quantum gyroscope.",Howard,Really? You’re a physicist?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,"The same, shortly after, demonstrating the quantum gyroscope.",Colonel Williams,Better. I’m an engineer.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,"The same, shortly after, demonstrating the quantum gyroscope.",Leonard,Where did you go to school?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,"The same, shortly after, demonstrating the quantum gyroscope.",Colonel Williams,MIT.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,"The same, shortly after, demonstrating the quantum gyroscope.",Howard,"Oh. Well, hey, me, too."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,"The same, shortly after, demonstrating the quantum gyroscope.",Colonel Williams,"I should have known. Behind every great invention is an MIT mind. I’ll cut to the chase. The Air Force believes there’s an application for this technology, and we’re interested in funding your research."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,"The same, shortly after, demonstrating the quantum gyroscope.",Howard,"Well, thanks, but you should know we’re a little concerned about this being used in weapons."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,"The same, shortly after, demonstrating the quantum gyroscope.",Colonel Williams,"Oh, well, let me put your mind at ease. What we use it for is none of your business."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,"The same, shortly after, demonstrating the quantum gyroscope.",Leonard,I don’t know how I feel about this.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,"The same, shortly after, demonstrating the quantum gyroscope.",Colonel Williams,"Look, guys, it’s just a guidance system. It’s not like you’re handing us the Death Star from Star Trek. All you need to worry about is, right now, it’s this big, and we need it to be this big."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,"The same, shortly after, demonstrating the quantum gyroscope.",Leonard,That’s a lot less big.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,"The same, shortly after, demonstrating the quantum gyroscope.",Colonel Williams,"Yes, it’s this much less big."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,"The same, shortly after, demonstrating the quantum gyroscope.",Howard,I’m not even sure that’s possible.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,"The same, shortly after, demonstrating the quantum gyroscope.",Colonel Williams,"Well, I ran it by some colleagues at MIT, and they thought they could get it done in four months."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,"The same, shortly after, demonstrating the quantum gyroscope.",Howard,Four months?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,"The same, shortly after, demonstrating the quantum gyroscope.",Sheldon,"Yeah, we’ll do it in two. Hi. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. I’m the actual brains behind this project. Also, engineers aren’t real scientists, MIT’s a trade school, and the Death Star is from Star Wars, not Star Trek. But otherwise, thank you for your service."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Amy,"Hi. Howard told me you were working late, so I brought dinner."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Bernadette,"Oh, thanks. You know, I just wanted to get some work done without people congratulating me about the baby every five minutes."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Amy,I spent my day alone in the lab waiting for a rat to die of anthrax.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Bernadette,Did you come here to bring me dinner or to gloat?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Amy,"Well, I came to see how you were feeling, but I’m guessing still angry?"
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Bernadette,"I’m sorry. My boss wants to meet with me, and I’m stressing."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Amy,You really think they’re gonna start treating you differently?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Bernadette,"Are you kidding? I’ve always been treated differently. Look at me. Listen to me. I mean, the first thought when you see me isn’t that’s a scientist, it’s I wonder if her mommy"
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,,knows where she is.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Amy,I am really regretting that I got you a Happy Meal.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Bernadette,"I’ve worked so hard to get where I am, and I don’t want to get sent back to square one because I’m pregnant."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Amy,I understand how you feel.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Bernadette,Thank you.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Amy,I wish there were some way I could make it better.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Bernadette,"Well, you brought me French fries. That’s a start."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Amy,"Uh, actually, I got you apple slices ’cause you’re pregnant."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Bernadette,Apple slices? What kind of lunatic goes to McDonald’s and gets fruit?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Amy,I’ll be right back.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Bernadette’s office.,Bernadette,And a chocolate shake.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Penny,Hi.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Sheldon,Hello.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Penny,What are you doing?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard’s mad at me, so I’m making him lemon bars."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Penny,Does he even like lemon bars?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Not really. But I’m mad at him, too, so lemon bars it is."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Penny,Something happen at the meeting?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Sheldon,They made me promise I wouldn’t talk.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Penny,And you talked?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, now, see? You knew what was gonna happen. Why didn’t they? Anyway, now we’re committed to completing this project in a ridiculously short time frame, and everyone’s upset with me."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Penny,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, Bernadette’s mad at me, too."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Mm. If it makes you feel any better, a parasitoid wasp known as Oobius depressus has been rediscovered after 101 years of presumed extinction."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Penny,Why would that make me feel better?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Sheldon,Why would your Bernadette thing make me feel better? At least mine was educational.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Penny,Okay. Never mind.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Look, I’m sorry. Tell me why Bernadette is upset with you."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Penny,"Well, I told people at work that she’s pregnant. She wasn’t ready for them to know."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Sheldon,Why would you do that?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Penny,"Well, it just slipped out. I feel terrible."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,The apartment.,Sheldon,"See, that’s exactly what happened to me, except that I said it on purpose, and I have no regrets."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Raj,Is it even possible to get this done in two months?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Howard,"Well, maybe. I don’t know. We’ll have to work 12 hours a day, seven days a week."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Leonard,"Which means I won’t be able to make Penny breakfast every day, and she’ll realize my brioche French toast was the only thing keeping her in the marriage."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Howard,I love your French toast.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Leonard,"Oh, thanks, man."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Raj,"So, why did you guys even agree to the deadline?"
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Howard,We didn’t. Sheldon did.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Raj,And you just let him?
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Leonard,"Well, the colonel said it was for the good of the country, and the funding is substantial."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Howard,"No, but mostly, there was an awkward pause, and I broke it by saying okay."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Raj,So I guess I won’t be seeing you guys for a while.
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Leonard,"Oh, looks like it."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Raj,"Wow. You’re going off to work with the military, leaving me behind. Now I know how all those army wives feel."
Series 10,Episode 02,The Military Miniturization,Howard’s workshop.,Howard,Would you stop? We’re just gonna be on the other side of campus.

Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,Of course it does. Didn’t your baby room have a theme?

Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Leonard,I’m gonna get some coffee. You want some?
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Sheldon,"Uh, you’re really going to have caffeine in front of me when I’m trying to get my life back on track?"
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Leonard,"Uh, okay, let’s pretend you do have a problem."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Sheldon,I do.
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Leonard,You don’t.
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Sheldon,"Yeah, but I do."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Leonard,"No, you don’t. But let’s say you do. And don’t say you do, because you don’t. Now, wouldn’t you think that throwing yourself into your work would be the best way to deal with it?"
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Sheldon,With what?
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Leonard,Your problem.
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Sheldon,I thought I didn’t have a problem.
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Howard,That was painful to watch.
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Bernadette’s car.,Raj,So where are we going?
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Bernadette’s car.,Bernadette,I don’t know.
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Bernadette’s car.,Raj,Okay. How Thelma and Louise of us.
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Bernadette’s car.,Bernadette,"Raj, why don’t I care about anything?"
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Bernadette’s car.,Raj,I’m sorry?
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Bernadette’s car.,Bernadette,"It’s my baby. I, I should care about nurseries and colours, and I don’t. What’s wrong with me?"
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Bernadette’s car.,Raj,"Well, crime-scene photos near your crib spring to mind."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Bernadette’s car.,Bernadette,"I keep waiting to feel excited, but it’s not happening. What if it never happens?"
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Bernadette’s car.,Raj,"Bernadette, come on, look, you’re overthinking this, okay? You’re gonna be an amazing mom. Even if you don’t believe it, I know you have maternal instincts."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Bernadette’s car.,Bernadette,"Once, I was supposed to babysit my brothers. Our neighbour found them naked in the backyard eating crickets."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Bernadette’s car.,Raj,"Happy and well-fed. You see, that’s what I’m taking from that story."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Sheldon,"Leonard, can I ask you a question?"
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Leonard,Is it about the rotational symmetries you should be figuring out or your fake caffeine problem?
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Sheldon,"Howard, can I ask you a question?"
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Howard,No.
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Sheldon,"All right, I’ll just toss this out to the room. Um, I was thinking that the best way to fight my addiction is by weaning myself off in steps. Now, I couldn’t find a caffeine patch, but I did find what claims to be a mind-boosting caffeine suppository. You know, the interesting fact about the rectum…"
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Leonard,"Sheldon. We are dealing with an impossible deadline from the Air Force because of you. So have an energy drink, don’t have an energy drink. Order suppositories and shove ’em wherever you want, I don’t care."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Sheldon,You don’t shove them. They come with an easy-glide applicator.
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Leonard,Right. Listen to me. We can’t do anything until you do your part. So get up in front of this whiteboard and do it.
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Sheldon,I can’t.
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Leonard,"Yes, you can."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Sheldon,"No, I can’t figure out the math. I’ve been racking my brain for days, and I’ve got nothing."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Leonard,Seriously?
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Sheldon,I can’t do it. I’m not as smart as I think I am. I’m so sorry. This is all my fault.
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Leonard,"It’s okay, we’ll figure something out."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Sheldon,But what if we can’t?
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Leonard,It’ll be fine. You’ll see. Sheldon? Buddy?(Sheldon snores)
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Howard,"When the baby gets here, you gotta teach me that."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,,Bert’s apartment.
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Amy,"Thank you so much, Bert. This was great."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Bert,My pleasure. You girls want to take home a two-gallon tub of potato salad?
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Amy,I think we’re good.
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Bert,"Okay, well, thanks for coming by. You’re nice people."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Penny,"Well, so are you. In fact, you know what? We will never take you for granite. Did you get that? Granite? A little geology joke."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Bert,You need to leave. I’m in love with both of you now.
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Penny,Okay.
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,The lab.,Amy,Bye.
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Bernadette’s car.,Raj,"Uh, pull over."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Bernadette’s car.,Bernadette,"What? Why? Who are you calling? You’re gonna rat me out to Howard, aren’t you? You’re such a snitch, no wonder I don’t like you."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Bernadette’s car.,Raj,"Whoa, I’m calling my dad, okay? He’s got experience dealing with pregnant ladies because he’s an OBGYN. And experience with crazy ladies because of my mom."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Bernadette’s car.,Dr Koothrapalli(on facetime),"Hello, Rajesh. Are you calling to ask for money?"
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Bernadette’s car.,Raj,What? No.
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Bernadette’s car.,Dr Koothrapalli,Are you calling to ask for things that cost money?
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Bernadette’s car.,Raj,No.
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Bernadette’s car.,Dr Koothrapalli,Great. What’s up?
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Bernadette’s car.,Raj,"This is my friend, Bernadette. She’s pregnant, and she’s a bit worried, so I thought maybe you could talk to her."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Bernadette’s car.,Dr Koothrapalli,Of course. What seems to be the trouble?
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Bernadette’s car.,Bernadette,"Something’s wrong. I don’t care about any of the baby stuff every other mom is so into. Honestly, I’m not even sure I like babies."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Bernadette’s car.,Dr Koothrapalli,"Look, some people are baby people, and some people are not baby people. It doesn’t mean you won’t love your own baby."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Bernadette’s car.,Bernadette,But I thought I’d be more excited.
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Bernadette’s car.,Dr Koothrapalli,"Oh, being excited isn’t a guarantee of anything. Rajesh’s mother was thrilled when she was pregnant with him. After he was born, she doted on his every move. And you know what happened? He broke her heart, moved halfway around the world, and dates only poor white women. So you never know."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Bernadette’s car.,Bernadette,Thank you. I feel better now.
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Bernadette’s car.,Raj,Well I don’t.
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Bernadette’s car.,Dr Koothrapalli,"Good. Bernadette, I hope you have a daughter."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Colonel Williams’ office.,Leonard,"Um, I don’t really know how to say this."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Colonel Williams’ office.,Colonel Williams,"Well, you could try starting with sir."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Colonel Williams’ office.,Leonard,"Right. Sorry, sir."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Colonel Williams’ office.,Sheldon,"He said start with it, not end with it."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Colonel Williams’ office.,Leonard,Sir.
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Colonel Williams’ office.,Colonel Williams,Hmm?
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Colonel Williams’ office.,Howard,We’ve hit a bit of a snag. We’re already behind schedule.
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Colonel Williams’ office.,Sheldon,The computations required to overcome the deployability issues are more significant than we thought.
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Colonel Williams’ office.,Leonard,"I understand that we’re under contract, and I don’t know what the consequences of violating that are, but, uh, we’re not gonna be able to deliver in the time we promised."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Colonel Williams’ office.,Colonel Williams,How long do you need?
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Colonel Williams’ office.,Howard,"We, we’re thinking, two years."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Colonel Williams’ office.,Colonel Williams,All right.
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Colonel Williams’ office.,Howard,That’s it? You’re okay with that?
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Colonel Williams’ office.,Colonel Williams,"What, you think you’re the first government contractor who isn’t gonna deliver on time? We’re still waiting for a big space laser Reagan ordered to beat the commies."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Colonel Williams’ office.,Leonard,"Thanks for understanding, sir."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Colonel Williams’ office.,Howard,"Yes, thank you so much."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Colonel Williams’ office.,Sheldon,"We, we really appreciate it."
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Colonel Williams’ office.,Leonard(off),"All right, pressure’s off"
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Colonel Williams’ office.,Howard(off),Wanna see a movie?
Series 10,Episode 03,The Dependence Transcendence,Colonel Williams’ office.,Sheldon(off),Popcorn’s on me.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The foyer.,Amy,"And there was water everywhere, it was such a mess."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The foyer.,Leonard,That stinks. How long are you out of the apartment?
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The foyer.,Amy,About five weeks.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The foyer.,Penny,"Ugh, did you lose anything valuable?"
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The foyer.,Amy,"Well, the pipe was over my closet, so all my clothes are gone."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The foyer.,Penny,"Oh, so nothing. Great. Do they know why the pipe burst?"
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The foyer.,Amy,They didn’t say.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The foyer.,Leonard,Buildings that have a combination of copper and galvanized steel are susceptible to pinholes and corrosion caused by the mobility of ions in the water. Can’t have your head shoved in a toilet as much as I did and not pick up a few things about plumbing.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The foyer.,Penny,"Well, if you need a place to crash, you can stay with us."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The foyer.,Amy,Really?
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The foyer.,Penny,"Of course. You can stay in Leonard’s room, and we’ll stay at my place."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The foyer.,Amy,You’re sure that’s not an inconvenience?
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The foyer.,Penny,"No, not at all."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The foyer.,Leonard,"And we live with Sheldon, so the word inconvenience has really lost all meaning."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The foyer.,Amy,"So, technically, I’d be moving in with my boyfriend?"
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The foyer.,Penny,I guess so. And I’d finally get to live alone with my husband.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The foyer.,Amy,"Oh, my, this is a big step."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The foyer.,Leonard,"Mm-hmm. For two of us, it’s in the right direction."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The foyer.,Sheldon,Why are you all smiling like crazy people?
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The foyer.,,Credits sequence.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Cohabitation with my girlfriend? That’s a great deal to process.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Leonard,It’s only for five weeks.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Penny,"Yeah, and we’ll be right across the hall."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Amy,What do you think?
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Sheldon,I don’t know. What if living together kills the romance?
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Penny,"Okay, you guys had sex one whole time. Nothing can put out a fire like that."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Yeah, but what happens when we each get a peek behind the curtain? I mean, she’s never even seen me unshaven."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Leonard,You just shaved yesterday. You’re good for three months.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Amy,"Sheldon, I understand your apprehension, but let me appeal to the scientist in you. Given the five-week end date, isn’t it the perfect opportunity to consider this an experiment and collect data on our compatibility?"
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Don’t try luring me in with sexy talk.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Okay. Star Trek, the original series, the Enterprise was on a five-year mission to explore new worlds. Think of this as your personal five-week mission to do the same."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"If you want to lure me in with sexy talk, that’s how you do it."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Penny,Don’t be proud of that.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Amy,"So, is that a yes?"
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Not yet. How will I learn if I’m comfortable living with Amy or just comfortable because I’m in my own apartment? Now, if this experiment is going to be valid, I suggest a neutral environment."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Penny,"Well, where would you go?"
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, ideally, an enclosed, self-sustaining biodome in New Mexico, where we would eat crops fertilized with our own waste."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Leonard,"And you were worried about the romance. 00:03:18,914"
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Penny,"Wait. Why don’t you guys stay across the hall, and we will live here?"
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Interesting. If my official residence were across the hall, I wonder if I’d need to knock every time I came over here."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Leonard,That’s a good question. Maybe just don’t come over.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Historically, I don’t do well with change."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Penny,"Okay, it won’t be that bad. We wouldn’t even sit in your spot while you’re gone."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"You’re darn right, you wouldn’t. No matter where I am, this will always be my spot. Like an embassy in a foreign country, this seat is the sovereign soil of my bottom."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Leonard,Just nod and smile. He’s almost gone.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Amy,"Sheldon, what do you think?"
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Very well. I’m on board.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Amy,Seriously?
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Yes. I accept this five-week mission to share a living space with my girlfriend.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Amy,Oh. This is so exciting.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, now, don’t be surprised if, like Star Trek, it’s cancelled in three."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"I have to say, I am happy with your OBGYN."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,Cool. ‘Cause she says you’re doing a great job as weird friend who doesn’t have to be at every appointment.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,I’m the son of a gynaecologist. I could be helpful.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,It would help if you stopped telling me I have a textbook cervix.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"The polite response is, thank you for noticing."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Let me see the sonogram again. Oh, yeah, that’s a good-looking baby for a little grey blob."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Yeah, we could name him Blobert."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,What if it’s a girl?
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,Bloberta. Or Blobbi with an I.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Are we being silly not finding out the sex?
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"If you want, you can find out right now."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,Mm.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Hmm. The doctor’s gone for the day, so it doesn’t matter."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"Well, somebody else knows because they saw it in the folder."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,You looked in our folder?!
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,It was an accident. The doctor left the folder out on her desk. It’s not my fault I opened it and looked.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"So you know the sex of our baby, and we don’t?"
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,Flip a coin. You got a fifty-fifty shot.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,It’s unbelievable.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"God, Raj."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"What? This is not a problem, okay? If you don’t want to know, I don’t have to tell you."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,We don’t want you to know.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"Okay, well, that’s a problem."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"You know, I’m very proud of you for trying to live with Amy."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,Oh. Thank you.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,Mm.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Of course, the ideal way to conduct this experiment would be with four pairs of identical Sheldons and Amys. One pair that was neither dating nor living together. One pair that was dating but not living together. One pair that was living together but not dating. And then, of course, one pair that was living together and dating. Although, with that many Sheldons, it’d be such a party, we’d never get anything done."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"That was a cute story. So, um, what did you want to ask me?"
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, you’ve lived with your significant other for some time. I would like this experiment to go well. Are there any insights you can share?"
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s apartment.,Penny,"Mm. Well, the biggie is, if she has an insane roommate, kick him out as soon as possible."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s apartment.,Sheldon,"You know, Leonard and I were very happy before you came along."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Amy,You’ve been roommates with Sheldon forever. Do you have any advice?
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Leonard,I’m trying to think of an answer that won’t stop you from doing this.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,,Cutting between Penny’s apartment and Leonard and Sheldon’s apartment.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Penny,"I know it sounds like a cliché, but compromise is key."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Never leave a belt on the floor. At night, they look like snakes."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Penny,"Do little things, like bring her a cup of coffee in bed."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Leonard,Keep M&M’S in your pocket in case you have to wait in a long line.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Penny,"You’re gonna be seeing each other a lot, so respect each other’s personal space."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Leonard,"He startles easily, so, please, no flash photography."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Sheldon,How many pairs of underwear did you pack for the move?
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Amy,I don’t know. I didn’t count.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Sheldon,You truly are the Goofus to my Gallant.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Amy,"That’s me. Listen, you and I are gonna be sharing a bed. You know, this is uncharted territory for both of us. How are you feeling about that?"
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"Oh, excited, concerned, a little scared. All the same emotions I feel in line at Space Mountain."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Amy,"Well, if you’re nervous about the sleeping arrangements, maybe we should talk about it."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Sheldon,Okay. Talk.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Amy,"Well, I imagine one of your concerns might be coital expectations."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"Wow, no foreplay or anything, just right to it."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Amy,"Look, I know this experiment is a big step outside of your comfort zone. So why don’t we take being physical off the table and maybe later on, once we’re more settled in, we can revisit it."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Sheldon,You’re really okay with that?
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Amy,"I’ve never lived with someone, either. This is a lot for me, too."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"This is such a relief. Honestly, if it didn’t get you all worked up, I’d kiss you right now."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Amy,Good call. Seeing your Teen Titans underwear really got my motor running.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Sheldon’s bedroom.,Sheldon,I know. They probably shouldn’t sell those to children.

Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The hallway.,Amy,Thank you.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The hallway.,Sheldon,Enjoy having the place to yourselves.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The hallway.,Leonard,You enjoy your mission to boldly go where no man has gone before.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The hallway.,Sheldon,It’s Penny’s bedroom. Plenty of men have gone before.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The hallway.,Penny,"Now, now, there’s no need to make this emotional."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The hallway.,Amy,Shall we?
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The hallway.,Sheldon,I guess this is it.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The hallway.,Leonard,You guys have fun.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The hallway.,Sheldon,"You, too. Oh, don’t forget. Tuesday the air filters need to be changed."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The hallway.,Penny,"Yeah, you wrote it on my hand."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The hallway.,Sheldon,"Oh. Oh, and every other day, check the water level on the avocado pit."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The hallway.,Leonard,"I’m on it. 15 years from now, we’ll make guacamole together."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The hallway.,Sheldon,"Leonard, please, let me go."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The hallway.,Amy,"Come on, Sheldon."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The hallway.,Sheldon,Oh. Bye.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The hallway.,Leonard,Good night.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The hallway.,Penny,Good night.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The hallway.,Amy,"Well, that’s it. For the next five weeks, we are officially living together."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The hallway.,Sheldon,I guess the experiment begins.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The hallway.,"Penny(off, screaming)","Wa-how, we did it."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The hallway.,"Leonard(off, also screaming)",Yeah.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Sheldon,Which side of the bed would you prefer?
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Amy,Doesn’t matter to me. Your choice.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"No, no, we’re living together now, everything’s equal. You know? I know that I have a tendency to be controlling, so I would rather you choose."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Amy,"Well, Sheldon, I really appreciate that, but these things mean more to you than they do to me, so whatever you want."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"Well, clearly, it’s not whatever I want, because what I want is for you to make this decision, and you refuse to do that."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Amy,"Well, I’m not refusing. I’m just trying to be considerate."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"Like when you let me get those shoes with the wheels on the bottom, and then watched me roll right into traffic?"
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Amy,"Sheldon, will you please just pick a side?"
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"Fine. Okay. Now, on this side, I am closer to the exit in case of emergency."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Amy,Great. That’s your side.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"No, but I’m also closer to the entrance in case of attack."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Amy,"Okay, I’ll take that side."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"Ah, then again, what are the odds of someone attacking me?"
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Amy,Rising rapidly.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"Now, this side offers me proximity to the bathroom, but I am closer to the window where perverts can watch me sleep."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Amy,Okay. What if we do this?
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Sheldon,I suppose that works.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Amy,Great.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Sheldon,Although now I’m kind of worried someone’s hiding behind those drapes.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,"This is ridiculous. The doctor knows what the baby is, the ultrasound tech knows, Raj knows, his Grey’s Anatomy online fan group probably knows. Is it weird we don’t?"
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,I don’t know. Maybe the surprise will make it more fun. Like magic tricks. Remember how disappointed you were when I explained the never-ending hanky?
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,I was disappointed to see the man I was engaged to pulling rainbow scarves out of his fly.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,But how delightful was it when I pulled out a bouquet at the end of those scarves? It’ll be the same thing when the doctor pulls a beautiful surprise out of you.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,Everyone said I could do better.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,"But you didn’t listen, and presto change-o, my baby’s inside you. Ta-da."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Amy (off),Ugh. What is that?(Entering)Why did you switch sides?
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Sheldon,Be grateful I’m still in the room.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Amy,Comfy?
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"Oh, I’m just happy I don’t know what this memory foam remembers."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Amy,"Sheldon? I know we took coitus off the table, but I was wondering how you feel about other forms of intimacy, such as snuggling."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"Well, it’s funny you should ask, because I was wondering how you’d feel about separating the two of us with a pillow wall."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Amy,"Sheldon, I’ve made more than enough accommodations for you. We’re both grown adults, we’ve been far more intimate than this. If you don’t want to snuggle, fine, but we’re not building a pillow wall."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"Okay, well, I am sorry. I’m just worried that my sensitivity to temperature could make this a rough night. And no offence, but your bottom radiates enough heat, I’m surprised there aren’t iguanas lying on it."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Leonard,"That’s it. It’s Sheldon’s bedtime, he is in for the night."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Penny,Wow. I cannot believe we are alone in our own apartment.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Leonard,"It’s weird. This must be how parents feel when their kid goes off to college. Unless they feel sad, then it’s different."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Penny,"So, what do you want to do?"
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Leonard,I know exactly what we are gonna do.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Penny,"Really? You’re a genius, and that’s the first thing you come up with?"
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon’s not here, so we are going to put on music and dance in our underwear."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Penny,Ugh. Can we just have sex?
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, don’t worry. Once you see my sweet moves, sex is inevitable."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Penny,"Inevitable, you say?"
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Leonard,I’ll just let my hips do the talkin’.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,Screw it. I’m calling and finding out.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,"Good. Call him. Wait, I’m not sure I want to know."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,But you just said you wanted to know.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,"Well, now I don’t know if I want to know!"
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Raj,Hello?
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,Call you back.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"No, Dr. Feynman. If I solve it for you, you’ll never learn."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Penny,"Wow, where did you learn these moves?"
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Leonard,"The world may have forgotten about Dance Dance Revolution, but not this smooth criminal."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,"Okay, you’re positive you want to know?"
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,Yes.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,Okay. Here we go. It’s ringing.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Raj,Hello?
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,Wait.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,Wrong number.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Penny,I told you not to do the worm.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Leonard,You were right.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Raj’s bedroom. Phone rings.,Raj,Hello.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Raj’s bedroom. Phone rings.,Bernadette(off),"I changed my mind, hang up, hang up."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Amy,"Oh, oh, oh."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Sheldon,What are you doing down there?
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Amy,Hang on.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,Penny’s bedroom.,Sheldon,Who are you calling? Aaargh!
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Amy,I’m so sore. I don’t think I slept two minutes last night.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Penny,"Yeah, get it, girl."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Amy,It’s not what you think.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Leonard,I feel like I pulled something. Why didn’t you tell me to stop?
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Penny,Even more not what you think.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Amy,I don’t know if I can make it through five weeks living with him.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Leonard,"If you ever need a break, the owner of the train store will let you leave him there while you get a coffee."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Penny,Yeah.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Good morning. See? I didn’t knock, but it’s fine. I didn’t knock, but it’s fine. I didn’t knock, but it’s fine. So, how is everyone?"
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Amy,Miserable and exhausted.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Really? I slept great.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Amy,"Well, I didn’t, and it’s your fault."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Sheldon,How? You had the whole floor to yourself.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Amy,"Sheldon, maybe living together is a bad idea."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, but what kind of scientists would we be, drawing a conclusion after only 12 hours of data?"
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Amy,The kind who almost put a pillow over your face last night.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Wow. I anticipated we’d have problems, but I never thought your scientific rigour would be one of them."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Amy,"I’m sorry, are you questioning my integrity as a scientist?"
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Sheldon,If the lab room disposable shoe cover fits.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Penny,Was that a science diss?
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Leonard,Yeah.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Penny,Was it a good one?
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Leonard,Eh.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Penny,Oh.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Amy,"What would a theoretical physicist understand about an experiment anyway? I mean, you wouldn’t know a confounding variable if two of them hit you in the face at the same time. And you don’t even get that joke, ’cause you don’t even work with confounding variables."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Sheldon,How dare you?
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Amy,"Oh, you heard me. Your experimental bona fides are laughable."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Whoa, whoa! Now you’re making fun of my bona fides?"
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Amy,Can’t make fun of something that’s a null set.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Penny,I feel like I should say damn.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Leonard,Do it.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Penny,Damn.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, if you are so protective of the scientific method, perhaps we should use the next five weeks to finish what we started."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Amy,"Well, for science, maybe I will."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"For science, maybe you should."
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Amy,Fine.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Fine.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Amy,Good.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Great.
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Amy,Do you want to go to our place and make out?
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Does Stephen Hawking roll through the quad?
Series 10,Episode 04,The Cohabitation Experimentation,The apartment.,Penny,The new neighbours are weird.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,,,Following a previously on scene…
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Penny,"Okay, I’m confused. Which one is Mr. Robot?"
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Leonard,I’ll give you a hint. We’re watching Daredevil.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Sheldon,Will you two please inform Amy how much you enjoy adhering to a strict bathroom schedule?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Penny,Can’t.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Leonard,Won’t.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Penny,Didn’t.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Leonard,Don’t.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Amy,"I told you, you can’t regulate every aspect of our lives."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Sheldon,I can if you’d just roll over and accept your fate.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Amy,I’m sorry for bringing this over here.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Penny,"Believe me, we know what you’re going through."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Leonard,And I think the most helpful thing we can tell you is no backsies.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Penny,Mm-hmm.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Amy,"Sheldon, I understand that you like things a certain way and I’m willing to make some concessions, but you have to be open to compromise."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Penny,She’s right. That’s reasonable.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, look who’s in favour of compromise, the woman who married Leonard Hofstadter."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Leonard,"Hey, she didn’t compromise. She settled. There’s a difference."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Penny,"Yeah. You tell him, babe."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,,Credits sequence.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The comic book store.,Raj,What time do you and Bernadette head out?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The comic book store.,Howard,As soon as I get home. We’re hoping to make it before dark.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The comic book store.,Raj,I’ve never been to Palm Springs.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The comic book store.,Stuart,"Oh, you should go. It’s terrific. I really thrive anywhere the women and the temperature are over 90."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The comic book store.,Raj,"I don’t know. If I want to watch old people sweat, I can just FaceTime my family in India."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The comic book store.,Stuart,It’s nice you and Bernadette are getting away.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The comic book store.,Howard,"Well, she wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The comic book store.,Stuart,So then what are you doing here buying comic books?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The comic book store.,Howard,"Well, he wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Leonard,"When you live with someone, there’s gonna be conflict. You just have to keep communicating."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Sheldon,Well I’m open to that.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Amy,"Okay. Well, for starters, there’s nothing wrong with keeping our toothbrushes in the same holder."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Penny,"Sheldon, what do you say to that?"
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Sheldon,I think we should see other people.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Amy,What?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, as a male, I have an evolutionary drive to perpetuate my DNA. Restricting myself to a single partner is against my nature."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Amy,We sleep together once a year. You want other partners?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Don’t blame me. Blame your pal, biology. He’s the pervert pulling the strings here."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Amy,You wanna see other people? Go see other people.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Penny,"I hope one of those people is a monkey, ’cause this is bananas."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Leonard,"Hey, you can make jokes, but if this keeps up, he’s gonna move back in here."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Penny,"All right. Well, let’s just get them apart for a while so they can cool down."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Leonard,"Good. Then before we reintroduce them, we’ll give him one of her sweaters so he can get used to her scent again."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Penny,So it’s okay for you to joke around?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Leonard,"No, that’s actually what we did with him when Howard came back from space."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,"Honey, how ya feeling?(Sound of Bernadette vomiting violently)The book says at this stage of the pregnancy morning sickness should be going away.(More vomiting)So that’s good news, right?"
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette(pff),The only thing I hate more than you right now is that book.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,"There she is. Who’s ready for a hot, three-hour car ride to the desert?"
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,Next vomit is gonna be in your lap.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,I’m sorry. We don’t have to go.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,But it’s our last chance to take a vacation that’s just the two of us.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,How ’bout we stay here? We don’t even have to tell anyone. It’ll be like a secret vacation at home.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,"Keeping secrets from our friends, it does sound kinda fun."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,Does it sound sexy?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,You just heard me throwing up.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,You bet I did.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,You’re so weird.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,You know what’s weird? How turned on you are right now.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Penny’s car.,Sheldon,"You know, people are quick to accuse me of being difficult to live with, but the truth is, Amy is just as challenging."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Penny’s car.,Penny,Just as challenging?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Penny’s car.,Sheldon,Yes.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Penny’s car.,Penny,As you?

Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Penny’s car.,,and headed for the storm cellar.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Penny’s car.,Penny,"Leonard breathes on me, too. It’s not a big deal."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Penny’s car.,Sheldon,She’s always complaining about people at work.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Penny’s car.,Penny,"Well, so does Leonard. It’s kind of annoying, but it’s not the end of the world."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Penny’s car.,Sheldon,"Do you know that when I get out of the shower, she eyes me up and down like I’m a piece of meat?"
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Penny’s car.,Penny,"You know, so does Leonard. Can’t I just get ready in the morning without him giving me his goofy thumbs-up? Hey-hey-hey."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Penny’s car.,Sheldon,I know. Sometimes I would just like to be appreciated for my mind.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Penny’s car.,Penny,Agreed. Thank you.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,That feels great.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,"Well, pulling a quarter out of your ear isn’t the only magic these hands can do. In fact, what’s this between your toes?"
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,Can you please stop making money come out of me for two minutes? Was that the front door?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,"It sounded like it. Oh, my God. Someone’s in the house."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,"Lock the door, lock the door."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,We should call the police.

Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,Who would use our hot tub?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,"Well, the answer is both more and less disturbing than you think."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,Who is it?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,Stuart. He heard me talking about us going away. I guess he decided to invite himself over?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,Should we say something to him?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,"Maybe. How ’bout, hey, you look like a boiled chicken breast?"
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,"I meant like, what are you doing here?"
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,"Nah, that’s not gonna hurt his feelings."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Amy,Why is nothing easy with him?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Leonard,"Look, here’s the thing you need to understand about Sheldon. He’s the worst."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Amy,I prefer to think of it as high-maintenance.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Leonard,"I prefer to think of myself as five-ten, but I still need to get all my pants hemmed."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Amy,I guess I should have known what I was getting myself into.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Leonard,Don’t beat yourself up. You’ve never lived with anyone before.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Amy,That’s true.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Leonard,"And you’re starting out with Sheldon Cooper. That’s like getting your first pet and having it be, I don’t know, what’s a kind of pet that ruins your life?"
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Amy,You’re not making me feel better.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Leonard,"Look, even when Penny and I started living together, there was a learning curve. But I promise you, it does get easier."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Amy,"He put a sign up in the bathroom that says, number of days without Amy’s hair on the soap."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Leonard,Yeah. My record was six.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Bernadette,"Is it me, or is there something fun about watching him just float there?"
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Howard,Maybe this is why people get fish tanks. Who just turned the porch lights on?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Bernadette,Is someone else here?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Raj,Hmm. They must have left the tub on. Good thing I stopped by. Ah. Aaaaah! What are you doing here?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Stuart,What are you doing here?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Raj,Maybe Howard and Bernadette said I could be here.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Stuart,Did they?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Raj,"Answer the question, what are you doing here?"
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Stuart,"I had nothing else to do tonight. The last couple of months, I come here when I know they’re not home."

Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Stuart,"They heard me in the bushes once, but they thought I was a raccoon."

Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Penny’s car.,Penny,"You know, one night, Leonard’s nose whistled so loud, I swear it was like sleeping on a train track."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Penny’s car.,Sheldon,Have you noticed it’s always an A-flat?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Penny’s car.,Penny,Is it? Oh. It’s like his sinuses are right here in the car.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Penny’s car.,Sheldon,"If we’re just going to drive around aimlessly, the least you could do is take me for ice cream."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Penny’s car.,Penny,"Yeah, I’ll take you for ice cream."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Penny’s car.,Sheldon,"Well, see, why can’t Amy be that subservient? She has coitus one time, suddenly she’s Gloria Steinem. Anyway, I suppose an ice cream parlour will be a good place to meet other women."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Penny’s car.,Penny,"Oh, please, you’re barely interested in a physical relationship with one person. Why would you want to confuse and disappoint others?"
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Penny’s car.,Sheldon,"Being with Amy has awoken the sexual creature within. When I see a pretty gal walking down the street, I think, hubba hubba, like any other guy."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Penny’s car.,Penny,You kiss your mother with that mouth? ‘Cause it’s fine.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Raj,Here you go.

Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Raj,Shall we toast?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Stuart,"To Howard and Bernadette, and the house key they never asked me to return."

Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Howard,"Well, clearly, I lied."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Raj,So how’s your apartment?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Stuart,Not great. The electricity’s out.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Raj,So why don’t you get it fixed?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Stuart,"I called, and they’re like, pay your bill."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Raj,"If you ever need somewhere to crash, there’s always my place."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Stuart,"Oh, no. I don’t want to be an inconvenience. You’ve got all your lady friends, and…"
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Raj,"Actually, I’m single now."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Stuart,What? When did that happen?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Raj,"It’s okay. It’s by choice. Well, their choice, and it’s not okay."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Stuart,Oh. Sorry. I didn’t know.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Raj,Nobody does. I was embarrassed so I didn’t say anything.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Bernadette,Why wouldn’t he tell us? Are we bad friends?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Howard,He’s in our hot tub drinking our wine.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Bernadette,"Yeah, he deserves to be alone."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Stuart,So you’re back out on the dating scene now?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Raj,"Yeah, yeah, a little."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Stuart,"Oh, that must be fun. How’s that going?"
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Raj,"I’m in a hot tub with you, so pretty bad."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Amy,Maybe I should just give in to his stupid bathroom schedule.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Leonard,"No, don’t do that."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Amy,But you did.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Leonard,"Exactly. Learn from my mistakes. No matter where I am at 7:18am, there better be a toilet nearby."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Amy,It’s just so much easier to give him what he wants.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, true, but think of how much you’ve accomplished. Who got him to stop Purelling his pocket change?"
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Amy,Me.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Leonard,And who got him to put things other than gloves in the glove compartment?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Amy,Me. It was mittens.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Leonard,And who got him to try a turkey dog?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Amy,"That was actually Koothrappali, but I did let him spit it out in my hand."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Leonard,How can you stop now? That’s like walking out of Pinocchio right before he becomes a real boy.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Amy,"You know, you’re right. I’m in this relationship, too. I need to stand up for myself."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Leonard,Of course you do.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Amy,"And if he doesn’t like it, he can move back here."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Leonard,Oh. He can try. He’d just need a good locksmith.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,Penny,"Well, who you gonna hit on? The girl in front of us got strawberry. That’s your favourite."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,Sheldon,"No. No, if we both like it, I’ll spend the rest of my life opening the freezer and going, aw, no strawberry."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,Penny,What about the girl behind the counter?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,Sheldon,"Hmm? Well, she spends her whole day scooping. One arm’s probably bigger than the other."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,Penny,Is it possible you might not actually want to meet someone?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,Sheldon,You are truly wise.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,Penny,Thank you.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,Sheldon,"I’d say wise beyond your years, but you’re getting up there."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,Penny,All right. Come on. What is really going on with you?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,Sheldon,"Penny, I am going to tell you a story that I’ve never told anyone."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,Penny,All right.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,Sheldon,"I was 13 years old, and on spring break from college."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,Penny,Not relating. Go on.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,Sheldon,I came home early because they ran out of math to teach me.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,Penny,"Oh, now I’m with ya. Okay."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,Sheldon,"My mother was at bible study. I walked in the house expecting to find it empty, and I heard a sound coming from my parents’ bedroom. When I opened the door, I saw my father having relations with another woman."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,Penny,"Oh, that’s awful."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,Sheldon,"I know. It’s also why I never open a door without knocking three times. I mean, the first"
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,,"one’s traditional, but two and three are for people to get their pants on."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,Penny,"Well, what happened with your dad?"
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,Sheldon,"We locked eyes, I ran to my room, and we never, ever spoke of it."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,Penny,You poor thing.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,Sheldon,"Since Amy and I have been living together, we’ve been bickering like my parents used to."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,Penny,And you’re afraid you’re gonna do something like your dad did?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,Sheldon,Yes. I need to prepare her now to save her from pain down the road.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,Penny,"Down the road? Sheldon, she wanted to share a toothbrush holder with you, and now you’re at an ice cream parlour trying to pick up women."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,Sheldon,"Well, anything can sound silly when you put it in that tone."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,Penny,"Honey, instead of worrying about pain you might cause in the future, how about trying to fix the pain you’re causing her right now?"
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,Sheldon,"I’m sure you’re right. I suppose I should apologize to you, as well."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,Penny,Okay.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,Sheldon,That must have hurt watching me look for other women without ever even considering you. Please understand that I think of you as more of a nanny.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,An ice-cream parlour.,Penny,Just finish your ice cream so I can get you home to bed.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Raj,I wonder if this is what it feels like to be Bernadette’s baby.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Stuart,I don’t know. Bernadette’s baby doesn’t have a Jacuzzi jet hitting just the right spot.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Howard,"Those jets are for my secret spot, not his."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Bernadette,What do you do in there?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Howard,"It’s called relaxing, and that’s all you need to know."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Raj,"Well, it’s getting late. Maybe we should head home."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Stuart,"Yeah, you’re probably right."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Raj,You coming?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Stuart,"Yeah, just give me a minute."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Raj,Why?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Stuart,"Well, you know how you’re wearing a bathing suit?"
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Raj,Yeah?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Stuart,I kind of went the other way.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Howard,You jackasses just bought yourselves a hot tub!
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Leonard,What do you think?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Amy,"It’s a nice enough spot. You know, if I’m going to start standing up for myself, this is exactly the kind of thing…"
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Penny,We’re back.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Amy,"Oh, hi. Hi."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Sheldon,Hello.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Leonard,How you guys doing?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Penny,We’re doing good. I think Sheldon has something he would like to say to Amy.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Sheldon,"I wanted to apologize for my behaviour today. It, it was unnecessary. This is warm. Oh, and also, I am willing to forego the bathroom schedule."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Amy,Oh. Really?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Leonard,Why does she get that? We never got that.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Penny,Do you want him back?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Leonard,I’m very happy for you.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Amy, you should know I was never really interested in seeing other women. And to prove how serious I am about us, I’m willing to take our relationship to the next level."
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Amy and Sheldon’s bathroom.,Sheldon,"Amy Farrah Fowler, will you share this toothbrush holder with me?"
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Amy and Sheldon’s bathroom.,Amy,I would love to.
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Amy and Sheldon’s bathroom.,Leonard,Did we really need to be here for this?
Series 10,Episode 05,The Hot Tub Contamination,Amy and Sheldon’s bathroom.,Penny,"Call me crazy, but I found it moving."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The apartment.,Penny,"Hey, have you ever heard of the Van Nuys Comic-Con?"
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The apartment.,Leonard,‭Yeah. It’s a dinky little convention where they sell collectibles and get sad D-list celebrities to appear. Why?
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The apartment.,Penny,I got asked to sign autographs there.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The apartment.,Leonard,That’s awesome. Is this for Serial Ape-ist?
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The apartment.,Penny,"Well, it could be for the monkey movie. It could be my haemorrhoid commercial. The list does not go on."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The apartment.,Leonard,When is it?
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The apartment.,Penny,It doesn’t matter. I’m not doing it.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The apartment.,Leonard,What? Why not?
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The apartment.,Penny,"You just said yourself, it’s sad."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The apartment.,Leonard,"Yeah, but it’s not pathetic, that’s where I draw the line. Come on, we’ll have fun."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The apartment.,Penny,I don’t know.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The apartment.,Leonard,"You’ll have nerds fawning all over you. If you don’t love that, this marriage is in trouble."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The apartment.,Penny,I guess it wouldn’t hurt to meet some fans and make a little extra money.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The apartment.,Leonard,"Yeah. Wow, An appearance by George Lucas… ‘s dermatologist. Oh, I want that autograph."

Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"We have people over all the time. We have the maintenance people, the pizza delivery man, that UPS driver who feels the need to ask how parts of me are hanging."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,You know what I meant.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"All right, fine. Let’s say that we were to entertain people. What type of gathering did you have in mind? Huh? A meal? Lunch? Brunch? Dinner? Afternoon tea? A formal tea? Hmm? Is it a party? And if so, what kind of party? Is it a cocktail party? A Tupperware party? Ooh, is it a surprise party? Oh, I hope it’s not a West Coast party, ’cause according to the man on the radio, a West Coast party don’t stop."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,I’m sorry I mentioned it.

Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,"Oh, I mean, I know you’re pregnant. I just never connected the idea of pregnancy and you actually having a baby."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,Which MIT did you go to?
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,"Oh, God, we are not ready to have an infant in this house. We don’t have a crib, we don’t have diapers, we’re not baby-proofed. Anyone can just walk in off the street and lift our toilet lids!"
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,"Howie, we have time to do all that stuff."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,Do we? Look at you. Willy Wonka would roll you to the juicing room.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,The next person kicking you will be me. Good night.

Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, everything we need for your autograph session, head shots, markers."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The apartment.,Penny,"Okay. Leonard, it’s sweet you’re excited about this, but it’ll be a miracle if one person asks for my autograph."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The apartment.,Leonard,Are you kidding? I once paid twenty dollars for Theo Sassler’s signature.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The apartment.,Penny,Who’s that?
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, I don’t even know. I just liked his name. Theo Sassler. Okay, and look at this. I even got a change maker. How much change you want, little lady?"

Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Well, that’s so nice. Who’s coming?"
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, uh, Stuart, Bert from the geology lab, and Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,You mean the Romanian lady on the second floor?
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Yes. Oh, fun story, she grew up with ten siblings. Or possibly penguins. Her English is atrocious."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,That’s an odd mix of people.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, for our first time hosting, I thought it would be wise to conduct a trial run. You know, like how I practiced for that Halloween haunted house by going into the bathroom at the bus station."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,You never went into that haunted house.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,You never saw what jumped out at me at the bus station.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Well, thank you, Sheldon. This is a fun surprise."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh. Well, the real surprise is how surprised you are that I’m great at surprises."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Well, that’s not a surprise at all. I mean, if I knew you were good at surprises, I would have"
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,,"expected the surprise, and therefore not have been surprised, but as it is, I didn’t know, and therefore my surprise should be unsurprising."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,Don’t get me all randy. Guests are on the way.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,Hi.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Hey, where you been?"
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Oh, we went and did a little shopping for the baby."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,Wait till you see the crib we found.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,You bought a crib without me?
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,You’re gonna love it.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"Yeah, it’s the highest rated one on the market. I wouldn’t even call it a crib, I’d call it a Fortress of Solitude for babies."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Sounds expensive.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Okay, well, I may have gone a bit overboard, but you can’t put a price on safety."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"Though if you did, it’s more zeroes than you’re expecting."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"But it’s the safest crib you can buy. And if you don’t like it, we can return it."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Fine.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"In our new minivan. Hey, what’s for lunch?"
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,You bought a minivan?
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"It’s for the baby, and I didn’t buy it. The dealer loaned it to me for a 24-hour test drive."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"Though we did ding up the back pretty good with the crib, so you might have bought a minivan."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,I don’t want to drive that. It’s such a mom car.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,The guy at the dealership said they’re not just for moms anymore.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"Then again, he did think you were my husband."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"They thought it at the ultrasound, why not at the car dealership?"
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Leonard,Never been on this side of the table before. I feel powerful.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Penny,Really? I feel like I’m selling candy so our team can get new uniforms.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Leonard,"Okay, so it’s four seventy-five for a signed black-and-white and nine ninety-five for a colour."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Penny,"Alright, why not five and ten bucks?"
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Leonard,"Well, I brought my moneymaker. Let me shake it."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Penny,"Hey, that guy’s looking over here."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Leonard,Oh. You think he’s your first autograph?
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Penny,I don’t know. Be cool. He’s coming. He’s coming. Hi.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Guy,Hi. I love your movie.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Penny,"Well, thanks."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Guy,It has got to be one of the worst things I’ve ever seen in my life.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Penny,Your love confuses me.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Leonard,Would you like an autograph?
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Guy,Sure.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Penny,Okay. Who do I make it out to?
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Guy,Daniel.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Penny,Okay.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Daniel,"I have to ask. Were you trying to be that bad, or are you just a terrible actress?"
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Penny,That did not clear things up.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Leonard,That’ll be four seventy-five.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Daniel,Keep the change.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Leonard,"But I-I-I, oh. Nothing about that was good."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"There’s nothing to be afraid of, Sheldon."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"The average cork speed is 25 miles per hour. If that is too fast around a school, it is certainly too fast around a kitchen."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Been 15 minutes. Just sayin’.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,Okay. I can do this. Just give me a moment… Oh! Mimosas coming up.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Bert,"I once left orange juice in my fridge so long, it tasted like a mimosa."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,How old was it
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Bert,It’s hard to say. I don’t remember much after I drank it.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Would you like one, Mrs. Petrescu?"
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Mrs Petrescu,"Yes. Drink is fun and good friends, Applebee’s."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,She’s learning English from TV.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Mrs Petrescu,"TV, good. Now back to you."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Stuart,"Hey, guys."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Hi, Stuart."

Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Oh, they’re pretty. Thank you."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Stuart, this is Bert from the Caltech geology lab, and this is Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs."

Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Bert,Hey.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Stuart,"So, what did I miss?"
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Bert,"Eh, we watched Sheldon try to open a bottle for 15 minutes."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Mrs Petrescu,15 minutes can save you 15% or more on car insurance.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Stuart,Anybody else coming to this thing?
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Penny,What’s your name?
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Jeff,Jeff.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Penny,Okay.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Jeff,My favourite part is your shower scene.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Penny,Been hearing that a lot today.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Jeff,I even have a screen grab on my phone.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Penny,"Yep, there they are."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Leonard,"Okay, let’s keep it moving."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Penny,Here you go.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Leonard,Should’ve punched that guy.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Penny,"Well, go ahead. He’s right over there."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Leonard,Why do you do that? Can’t you let me have my moment?
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Penny,Hello.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Awkward guy,Hi. I like your movies.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Penny,Thank you.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Awkward guy,I saw both of them.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Penny,"I assume we’re still talking about the movies, but after today, who knows."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Awkward guy,You think I could get a picture of us?
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Penny,"Oh, sure."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Awkward guy,"And, uh, could you be giving me a kiss?"
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Leonard,No. She cannot kiss. What is wrong with you people?
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Penny,Leonard…
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Leonard,"No, no, no. It’s not okay."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Awkward guy,Who are you?
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Leonard,I’m her husband.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Awkward guy,"No, you’re not."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Leonard,I am.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Penny,"Yeah, he really is."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Awkward guy,No.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s garage.,Howard,"It’s got a rearview camera, there’s a DVD player, oh, and check this out. It’s like we’re living in the future."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s garage.,Raj,"Hey, show her the trunk. Show her the trunk."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s garage.,Howard,"Imagine this, you’ve got the baby in one hand, groceries in the other, and you’re thinking, how am I gonna open this trunk?"
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s garage.,Bernadette,"I’m probably thinking, where’s my husband, and why isn’t he helping me?"
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s garage.,Howard,You don’t need my help when you can open the trunk with a simple kick of the foot.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s garage.,Raj,"No, it’s a gentle kick, you’re doing it wrong. Here. Give me those."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s garage.,Howard,"Uh, maybe it was more of a circle?"
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s garage.,Bernadette,It’s weird that guy thought you were a couple.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s garage.,Howard,Yes.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s garage.,Raj,Yes.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s garage.,Howard,"See? Easy. And look at all this cargo space. Now we’ll get the crib out and you can take it for a test-drive. I’m telling you, this van is gonna be… uuh-uuh, uuh-uuh."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s garage.,Bernadette,"Oh, is it your back?"
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Howard and Bernadette’s garage.,Howard,"Oh, yeah, oh, anyway, let’s just get in and see if the GPS can take us to the nearest emergency room."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"So until Amy’s apartment is fixed, she and I are living here together."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Bert,"I lived with my old girlfriend. She was a geologist, too."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Things didn’t work out?
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Bert,"I came home from work one day and she had taken everything. I’m warning you, hide your good rocks."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Mrs Petrescu,"My sister’s husband took all her things, too. Story at eleven."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Stuart,"Really, no one else is coming?"
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,This is it. You are the practice round.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Stuart,Practice round? For-for what?
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Uh, no. He, he just means that you were the first people we thought of."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"You know, exactly. We’ve never thrown a brunch before, and I wanted to work out all the kinks."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Stuart,"So, I’m like a lab rat before your real friends come over?"
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Hmm. You see, your words sound reasonable, but your face looks angry. Help me out here, this is not where I shine."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Stuart, you know you’re one of our favourite people."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Okay, now, see, you look sincere, but your words are completely false. I’m glad we did this test run, these brunches are wild."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Awkward guy,But how did you get her to go out with you?
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Leonard,"Well, she moved in across the hall."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Penny,And he started to slowly wear me down.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Leonard,Like a river carves a canyon.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Penny,"Yeah, except the river kept showing me his Pokémon cards."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Red-haired guy,Ready to go?
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Awkward guy,Hang on. This guy’s telling me how he got the Serial Ape-ist girl to marry him.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Red-haired guy,This guy? But he’s wearing a change maker.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Penny,I think it’s hot.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Leonard,That’s right. I’m her change daddy.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The minivan.,Howard,Aaaaah. What was I thinking? Wolowitzes are not a lifting people. We tip the lifting people.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The minivan.,Bernadette,Do we really have to sit for hours in the emergency room? They’re just gonna give you ice and Advil like last time.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The minivan.,Howard,"You’re gonna feel terrible when I’m in a wheelchair. Which, by the way, would fit easily in the back of this award-winning minivan."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The minivan.,Bernadette,"Fine, we’ll go to the E.R. Just stop selling me on the van."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The minivan.,Howard,You’re right. It sells itself.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The minivan.,Raj,"You have to admit, it’s a pretty smooth ride."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The minivan.,Bernadette,I was hoping it’d be quieter.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The minivan.,Howard,"If childbirth is half this bad, you are so screwed. Are we there yet?"
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The minivan.,Bernadette,Soon.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The minivan.,Howard,Why is it taking so long?
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The minivan.,Raj,"Howard, Howard, look at the DVD screen. I put on Batman: The Animated Series. Your favourite."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The minivan.,Howard,"I’m in too much pain to watch cartoo… oh, this is a good one."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The minivan.,Raj,I’ve been babysitting him way longer than you have.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The minivan.,Bernadette,Fine. I’ll buy the stupid van.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Bert,This is the best blintz I’ve ever had.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,Oh. Thank you.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Bert,It almost makes up for the incredibly awkward turn things took earlier.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Stuart,"You know what, I, I, I think I’m just gonna go."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"No, Stuart, don’t."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Stuart,"No, I consider you and Sheldon like my family, and I’m not even sure you think of me as a friend. You have any idea how that feels?"
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,We’re so sorry.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Stuart,I’m always the last one anybody thinks of.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, no, that’s not true. I mean, sometimes it’s Koothrappali. But we’re not supposed to say that ’cause he’s a minority."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Stuart,Bye.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Stuart, wait. I do know what it feels like to be left out."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Bert,"I know how it feels, too."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"All right, this is about me and him, you’re not part of it. Stuart, perhaps we do take you for granted, and that is not acceptable. Please know that you truly are a valuable member of our social group."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Stuart,Thank you.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"You know, in fact, I’d like to propose a toast. To Stuart. A fine man, a good friend and a wonderful guest."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Bert,"Hear, hear."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Cheers.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Mrs Petrescu,Cheers. Filmed before a live studio audience.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Leonard,And that is how a short asthmatic scientist landed a stone cold fox.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Awkward guy,Oh. Whoa. I didn’t know you can propose to the same person so many times.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Leonard,"The third time I did it in skywriting, but she never looked up."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Penny,"You know, once, I proposed to him."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Leonard,Yeah. I said no.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Red-haired guy,Why?
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Leonard,I just wanted to make her work for it.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Penny,"Yeah, that’s gonna cost you later."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Red-haired guy,Hang on. Is she just with you because you’re rich?
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Leonard,She makes more money than I do.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,The Comic-con.,Awkward guy,What? Who are you?
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,Do you know what else I love about you?
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Stuart,Hmm?

Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"No, I mean it. I mean it. It’s like you have the soul of a label maker."

Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,Hmm?
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Stuart,You never leave the house without a paper clip.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,You never know when two pieces of paper might temporarily need fastening in the top left corner.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Stuart,I also love how you never use swear words.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"You know, it turns out, you can hurt people just as well without ’em."
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Maybe I can get a little help putting some of this stuff away.
Series 10,Episode 06,The Foetal Kick Catalyst,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, calm down. I already put away five of these. You see? No muss, no fuss, not a single cuss."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Hello, I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper."

Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"No. And on the subject of subjects, is your use of the word subject the same or different as when we speak about the subject of a king?"
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"I have a feeling you’re still doing it. But I find that topic irresistible, so, now, in ancient Mesopotamia, the king referred to the people as his property."

Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The cafeteria.,Howard,"Oh. Well, just out of curiosity, what registers as odd to you?"
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Her behaviour. No, I have the feeling that she’s hiding something."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The cafeteria.,Leonard,I wouldn’t worry about it. She’s probably just distracted by work.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Well, whatever it is, it’s troubling me. And I can’t eat, I can’t sleep. And don’t even ask about the consistency of my bowel movements."

Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The cafeteria.,Leonard,She’s enjoying living with you and she didn’t want it to end early.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"So, she’s deceiving me in order to spend more time with me?"
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The cafeteria.,Leonard,Yes.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Oh. Well, I feel both flattered and hurt. Like when people say I look like that skeleton from Nightmare Before Christmas."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The cafeteria.,Raj,"Oh my God, that’s who you look like."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"Sheldon, this is not a big deal. It’s a little white lie, everyone does it."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The cafeteria.,Raj,"Not me, I’m a hundred percent honest in all of my relationships."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The cafeteria.,Howard,And how single are you right now?
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The cafeteria.,Raj,Eating cake on the toilet single.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Well, I won’t tolerate deception in my relationship. I have no choice but to confront her."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The cafeteria.,Howard,"Don’t do that, you’ve got gold here. Hang onto it until you’re in trouble and then throw it in her face."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The cafeteria.,Leonard,Why would you tell him that? That’s terrible advice.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The cafeteria.,Howard,So you wouldn’t want to have anything on Penny?
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"Well, of course not."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The cafeteria.,Howard,"So, if I actually know something right now, and I do, you don’t want me to tell you?"
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"Uh, no."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The cafeteria.,Howard,I’ll take that as a yes. She’s secretly been moving your collectibles into storage a little at a time and you haven’t noticed.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The cafeteria.,Leonard,Are you kidding me?
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The cafeteria.,Howard,"See, I’ve known that for weeks, but, you know, I waited till the moment when it would cause him the most pain."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Leonard and Penny’s bedroom.,Leonard,"Superman’s gone, my stormtrooper’s gone."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Leonard and Penny’s bedroom.,Sheldon,Your Klingon word-of-the-day calendar’s gone.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Leonard and Penny’s bedroom.,Leonard,"I’d say damn it in Klingon, but that wasn’t until next month."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Leonard and Penny’s bedroom.,Sheldon,It’s khoo-vakh.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Leonard and Penny’s bedroom.,Leonard,Khoo-vakh! She took my Where’s Waldo.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Leonard and Penny’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"No, no, he’s over there."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Leonard and Penny’s bedroom.,Leonard,"Oh, yeah, there he is."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Penny,"So, what’s the deal with your apartment? Why’s it taking so long?"
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Amy,"Um, it was a drywall problem."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Penny,"Oh, no, what happened?"
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Amy,"Well, the drywall got wet, and you do not want wet drywall because when drywall gets wet, it’s really more…"
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Penny,Wet wall?
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Amy,"Or damp wall, just as bad."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Penny,Mm. So why don’t they just get more drywall?
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Amy,"Well, they went to get some, but the woman at the wall store said it was going on sale and they should wait because the savings…"
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Penny,"Okay, are you done? Bernadette told me your apartment’s ready."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Amy,"I was done at wet wall, but you wouldn’t let it go."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Penny,But is Sheldon really believing all this crap?
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Amy,"Well, he started to question it, but then I fake sneezed on him and he ran to take a shower. Please don’t say anything, I feel terrible about this."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Penny,"Oh, don’t worry, I won’t."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Amy,Thanks.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Penny,The woman at the wall store?
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Amy,Let it go.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Sheldon,Are you going to confront Penny?
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Leonard,"Eventually, I guess. Although, I am kind of curious how long she thinks she can keep hiding my stuff without me knowing."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Hmm. You know, perhaps instead of confronting them, we should see how far they’re willing to spin their tangled webs. Like that Spider-Man action figure that used to be on your desk."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, my God, I’m going blind."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Penny,Hi.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Amy,Food’s here.

Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Amy,"Oh, uh, they’re still working on it."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Sheldon,Interesting. Very interesting.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Penny,"Yeah, we swung by her apartment on the way to the restaurant, and they’re gonna be fixing it for a while."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Wait, uh, you saw her apartment?"
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Penny,"I did, still a mess."

Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Penny,Okay. That’s enough. You know what? What is going on?
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Leonard,"Fine, I told Sheldon that her apartment’s been finished, but then you just said it’s not, so now I’m all confused."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Amy,Penny was just covering for me. My place has been ready for two weeks.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Sheldon,How could you lie to me?
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Penny,"Uh, she’s enjoyed living with you. It’s called being in love."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Leonard,"Mm-hmm, and what’s it called when you secretly get rid of all your husband’s stuff?"
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Penny,What? Tha… That is not true.

Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Leonard,You really didn’t think I’d notice my stuff was missing?
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Penny,"Uh, did you notice your key chain?"
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Leonard,Where’s Batman?
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Bernadette,Hey.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Penny,Why did you tell Howard I was hiding Leonard’s things?
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Bernadette,One sec. Why did you tell Leonard I told you Penny was hiding his things?
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Howard,"It just came up because we, we were talking about secrets and… wait, juH qachHom Dotlh Sov ‘Iv (Who knows the status of Amy’s apartment?)"
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Amy,Everybody stop it with that.

Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Leonard,And?
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Penny,And what? Your wizard robes are next to go.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Raj,"Now that everything’s out on the table, you, you think you two will keep living together?"
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Despite recent events, I do consider our experiment in cohabitation to have been positive."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Amy,Are you saying you’d like to live with me?
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Sheldon,I’m open to the possibility.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Penny,Ubamy bube cubool.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Amy,Whatever.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Howard,"You know, if he moves across the hall for good, Leonard could keep the stuff you don’t like in Sheldon’s old room. Solves everything."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Penny,That’s a great idea.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Leonard,"Ooh, maybe I could turn it into a gaming den."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Raj,That would be amazing.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Wuh wuh hold on, excuse me, that’s my room."

Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,"Sure, sure, we, we could live in my apartment."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,I hate your apartment.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,"Sorry, you brought it up?"
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"Well, I suppose we could find a whole new place. You know, and, technically, we don’t even have to stay in Pasadena. We could, we could move to Altadena or a place that doesn’t even end in dena."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,It’s kind of exciting. I mean we could do whatever we want.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,But what if we move and we don’t like it? What if there’s a smoker in the building? Or pets? Or there could be mould? There could be traffic noise. I’m gonna have to learn a whole new bus route. Are you trying to soothe me by singing the Star Trek theme as a lullaby?
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,Yes.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"I’m not a child, don’t do that."

Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Leonard and Penny’s bedroom,Penny,Thank you.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Leonard and Penny’s bedroom,Leonard,Which is why I got you this Pink Power Ranger. Put it anywhere you like.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Leonard and Penny’s bedroom,Penny,"Okay, but you may feel some discomfort."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Leonard and Penny’s bedroom,Leonard,"I’m kidding, I want you to feel at home here. Decorate it any way that makes you happy."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Leonard and Penny’s bedroom,Penny,Do you really mean that?
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Leonard and Penny’s bedroom,Leonard,I really do.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Leonard and Penny’s bedroom,Penny,"Great, and just so you know, I’m not getting rid of all your stuff."

Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,I’m struggling with the thought of leaving my old bedroom.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,Can it be more of an internal struggle?
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"I need to see it. While I’m gone, don’t breathe on my pillow."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,How about if I just don’t breathe at all?
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,That’s my girl. What on earth? What is going on?
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Leonard,"Oh, hey, Sheldon."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Penny,We turned your room into a sex dungeon.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon(waking up in bed),No.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,What is happening?
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The comic book store.,Howard,"Okay, last question. The chaps he was wearing, assless?"
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The comic book store.,Sheldon,Can we just focus on the decision I’m facing?
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The comic book store.,Raj,"We can, but for the record, all chaps are assless."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The comic book store.,Sheldon,"Gentlemen, please, this is a significant decision. Now, do Amy and I continue living together? Or do I move back in with Leonard?"
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The comic book store.,Leonard,Over my assless chaps you will.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The comic book store.,Howard,This isn’t complicated. Do you love Amy?
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The comic book store.,Sheldon,Yes.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The comic book store.,Raj,Do you like living with her?
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The comic book store.,Sheldon,Yes.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The comic book store.,Leonard,Do you know what you need to do now?
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The comic book store.,Sheldon,"Apparently, figure this out on my own ’cause you guys are no help at all."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Amy,Hi.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Sheldon,Hello.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Amy,What are you doing?
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Sheldon,I’m just contemplating Buridan’s donkey.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Amy,I understand. I’ll leave you be.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"What, you’re familiar with the reference?"
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Amy,Of course. Jean Buridan proposed a philosophical thesis stating that a hungry donkey placed between two equidistant bales of hay would be paralysed by indecision and would starve to death.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Sheldon,Exactly.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Amy,"Well, I wouldn’t want you to starve to death, so here’s an eggplant."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Sheldon,Thank you.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Amy,"You know, some people believe that Buridan was plagiarizing Aristotle."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Sheldon,Really?
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Amy,"Although, in Aristotle’s example, he proposed an equally hungry and thirsty man caught between food and drink."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Huh. Yeah, I wonder if that’s related to the 12th century Persian philosopher, Al-Ghazali and his story of a man caught between two dates."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Amy,"Are you suggesting Al-Ghazali was Aristotelian? ‘Cause if anything, he was anti-Aristotelian."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Al-Ghazali was anti-Aristotelian? Boy, you think you know a guy."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Leonard and Penny’s bedroom.,Penny,Okay. Open your eyes and see your new room.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Leonard and Penny’s bedroom.,Leonard,Wow.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Leonard and Penny’s bedroom.,Penny,I know I went a little overboard. We can always dial it back.
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Leonard and Penny’s bedroom.,Leonard,"No, no, no, no, no, it’s, it’s important to me that you have the bedroom you want."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Leonard and Penny’s bedroom.,Penny,"Oh, that means so much. I love you."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Leonard and Penny’s bedroom.,Leonard,"I love you, too."
Series 10,Episode 07,The Veracity Elasticity,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Leonard,"Just hiding some stuff in your closet, don’t tell Penny."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,How much will it hurt?
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Amy,It’s just a tiny skin sample. You saw me do it to myself.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,"On a scale of one to ten, where one is a pebble in your shoe and ten is the monkey you thought was your pet biting your face off."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Amy,A two.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,Eating a whole Altoid?
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Amy,"Sheldon, if I’m gonna synthesize a neural network from our skin cells, I need to harvest them. Now, I’ve done this dozens of times, but if you’re too scared you don’t have to."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,"No, this is for science. I can be brave for science."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Amy,Thank you.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,"Oh, jiminy, that’s cold."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Amy,Just think how happy you’ll be in a few weeks when I’ve converted our skin cells into functional brain cells.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,"All right, just warn me before you do it."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Amy,"Okay. Three, two, and we’re done."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,You tricked me. You didn’t say one.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Amy,"It didn’t hurt, did it?"
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,"No, but three, two and we’re done is incomplete. You know those things bother me. It’s like hearing da-da-da-da-da-dah without yelling…"
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Amy,"Okay, fine, one."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,Thank you. Now yell charge and we can get out of here.

Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Cleaner,"Oh, do I need a mop?"
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Raj,It’s a gravitational wobble. It could be a sign of an extrasolar planet that may contain life and someday be named after me.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Cleaner,"Oh, well, if it has life, maybe it already has a name, huh?"
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Raj,"Yeah, but it’s probably difficult to pronounce."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Cleaner,What is your name?

Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Amy,"If you’d give me a minute, I’ll tell you."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,"Oh, just let me look. Oh, my goodness. I see quivering black lines. Those must be neurons, oh, they’re so thick and beautiful."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Amy,"Those are your eyelashes, move. Well, Sheldon, I see astrocytes. Our combined skin cells are now a primitive neural network."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,"I have such a profound sense of creation. I, it’s like when I hatched sea monkeys, except that this is from my DNA, so this is like me monkeys."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Amy,These cells come from both of us.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,"Yeah, but us monkeys doesn’t pop. Oh, oh, oh, oh, wait, we monkeys, there you go. Hey, when can we start running tests on it?"
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Amy,No reason we can’t start right now.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,"What stimulus should we introduce it to first? Light, sound, temperature, oh, oh, let’s"
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,,expose it to images of me and you and see who it likes better.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Amy,"Sheldon, this is a rudimentary collection of neurons. I mean, it’s remarkable, but it’s still limited in what it can do."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,"I understand. She’s the mean one, I’m the fun one."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The apartment.,Howard,"Huh, they screwed up and gave us steamed broccoli."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The apartment.,Raj,"Oh, no, that’s mine."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The apartment.,Leonard,Really? The last green thing I saw you eat was a Skittle.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The apartment.,Raj,"Well, I can’t eat like a ten-year-old all the time."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The apartment.,Penny,"You’re dating somebody, who is it?"
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The apartment.,Raj,What? What are you talking about?
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The apartment.,Penny,You only watch what you eat when you’re afraid you might have to take your shirt off.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The apartment.,Howard,"No, she’s right. As long as I’ve known you, you’ve always been self-conscious about your cleavage."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The apartment.,Raj,That’s because you keep trying to stick pencils in it.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The apartment.,Penny,"All right, fine, don’t tell us."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The apartment.,Raj,There’s nothing to tell.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The apartment.,Penny,All right.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The apartment.,Leonard,How’s that broccoli?
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The apartment.,Raj,It’s gross but I have to eat it because I met somebody.

Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Bernadette,"Still, I can’t believe you can turn ordinary skin cells into functioning brain cells."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Well, I turned this one into a functioning boyfriend, so sky’s the limit."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Look, look, here I am standing next to the incubator. Uh, here is a microscopic view of the cells."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Bernadette,"Look at that, put them in a tiny Flash T-shirt and it’s you."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Aw. Yeah, this little guy can already recognize electronically transmitted images 20% faster than any other sample in Amy’s lab."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Bernadette,I’m running out of ways to act excited.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"So, enough about us, how are things going with you?"
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Bernadette,"Great, the doctor said the baby’s head is facing down now."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Good, you know, in case the exit isn’t clearly marked."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Yeah, I have to say, it is nice to share this experience with someone who’s on the same journey. Although right now ours is testing off the charts while yours is floating around in its own waste."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Bernadette,Are you actually comparing my human baby to your brain in a bowl?
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, I didn’t make you waddle up four flights of stairs for the heck of it."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Bernadette,You do realize my baby has functioning organs and can recognize voices.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Yeah, but ours can recognize a specific data stream among background noise."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Bernadette,Mine has a fully developed immune system.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,Ours doesn’t need an immune system because it lives in a state-of-the-art German incubator.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Sheldon, that’s enough."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Okay, fine. Let’s just agree that both creations are special in their own way and it is foolish to try and compare them. Although, we didn’t need to have sex with Howard for ours, so we win."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,A washroom at the university.,Raj,This is fun. I have never cleaned a toilet before.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,A washroom at the university.,Isabella,You’re kidding.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,A washroom at the university.,Raj,"No, I grew up with a house full of servants and now I have a cleaning lady who is a lovely woman who I have great respect for."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,A washroom at the university.,Isabella,"It’s okay, you’re allowed to have a cleaning lady."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,A washroom at the university.,Raj,"Oh, good, because she also walks my dog, buys my groceries and cuts my hair."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,A washroom at the university.,Isabella,I think that’s called a mommy.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,A washroom at the university.,Raj,"Uh, so forgive me, forgive me for being nosy, but is, is there a wedding ring under those pretty rubber gloves?"
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,A washroom at the university.,Isabella,"No, not for many years."

Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,A washroom at the university.,Isabella,"Yeah, I guess we do."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,A washroom at the university.,Raj,"Maybe there are other things we have in common. Come dinnertime, do you enjoy eating food?"
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,A washroom at the university.,Isabella,"Ay, Rajesh, I think you’re very sweet, but I work two jobs and I don’t have time for dating."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,A washroom at the university.,Raj,"Yeah, sure. I understand. Yeah, I’m very busy, too."

Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,A washroom at the university.,Raj,"Okay. I’ll leave. But just know, every time I come in here, I’ll be thinking of you."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,"Would you look at that? The image we gave it was 45% white noise, and it still managed to reconstruct it."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Amy,I’ve never seen results like this before.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,"Yeah, we need to stop for magnets on the way home, this is going right on the fridge."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Amy,Aren’t you glad you participated in this?
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,"Oh, I am. And you realize what the next step is?"
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Amy,Set up a second culture and try to replicate our results.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,"Uh, no. We lock that door, lower our underpants a little and make a baby."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Amy,Make a baby? What are you talking about?
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,Clearly the combination of our DNA is exceptional. Our child could be the next step in the evolution of mankind. We’ll be able to get into any preschool we want!
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Amy,"Sheldon, I’m not ready to have a baby."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,"Oh, yes, you are. I track your cycle. For the next 36 hours you’re as fertile as a manure-covered wheat field."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Amy,"Wow. I, I can actually feel the egg crawling its way back up."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,I don’t understand. I thought you’d be thrilled to procreate with me.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Amy,Not right now.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,"Oh, I see what’s happening here. You’re playing hard to get."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Amy,I’m not playing anything. We’re not making a baby today.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,Amy’s lab.,Sheldon,"Very well. Oops, how clumsy of me. You know what? Let me get that. Hey. Where are you going? I, did you even look at my bottom?"
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Raj,Welcome.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Isabella,What is this?
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Raj,"Oh, well, you said you didn’t have time to go out for dinner, so I thought we could have one right here."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Isabella,"Oh, Rajesh."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Raj,"Oh, come on, we’re in the telescope room. It’ll be like dining under the stars. You see this, uh, double zero? When it says zero one that means it’s twinkling. Sometimes it takes a while."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Isabella,"Rajesh, this is so sweet, but you, you know I’m working."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Raj,That’s why I already cleaned up in here and all the other rooms in the hall.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Isabella,"Well, I suppose that gives me a little time."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Raj,"Oh, please sit. I tried to cook you a meal from your homeland."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Isabella,"Oh, really? You made Cuban food?"
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Raj,"That depends, do they have Mexican food in Cuba?"
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The stairwell.,Penny,"Now, when he said make a baby, is it possible he meant out of Legos?"
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The stairwell.,Amy,No. He was explicit. Needlessly and freakishly explicit.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The stairwell.,Leonard,Why does he need a baby? He’s already hairless and smells like talcum powder.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The stairwell.,Penny,Could you two really have some sort of super-intelligent child?
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The stairwell.,Amy,"Well, there is a genetic component, but that doesn’t guarantee anything."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The stairwell.,Leonard,That’s true. Sheldon’s father once picked a fight with a cactus.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The stairwell.,Penny,"Yeah, but that’s just his Earth parents. We don’t know anything about the ones that sent him here."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Well, we know they were smart enough to send him away."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The stairwell.,Amy,"Hey, you’re talking about the person I love and have been avoiding for the past three hours. Oh, man."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The stairwell.,Penny,"Ooh, Sheldon gonna get some."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Well, have fun with whatever nightmare’s behind door number two."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Well, hello."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The stairwell.,Amy,Hello.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,Would you care for a brandy?
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The stairwell.,Amy,I don’t think so.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Good choice, it’s disgusting."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The stairwell.,Amy,"Sheldon, please stop trying to seduce me."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,Who’s trying to seduce you? After a long day I always turn on smooth jazz and spray deer musk on my inner thighs.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The stairwell.,Amy,I thought it smelled like a petting zoo in here.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,Anything you’d like to pet? Not my hair. There’s a lot of goop in it.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The stairwell.,Amy,"Okay, I’ve had enough."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Amy, come back. I don’t know how to open the oysters."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Raj,"So, um, what surprised you the most when you first came to America?"
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Isabella,"Well, I suppose how much people care about Oprah’s favourite things."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Raj,"I thought that, too. But then I got my first waffle maker and never questioned her again."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Isabella,"You know, I do have some time off this Sunday if you’d like to…"
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Howard,"Hey! I saw your car… Oh, sorry. Am I interrupting?"
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Raj,Uh.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Isabella,"It’s okay. Uh, I should get back to work."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Howard,Hi. Howard Wolowitz.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Isabella,Oh. Isabella Concepcion.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Howard,"Oh, yeah, the astronomer. Raj told us about you. Hey, free toilet paper."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Isabella,You told him I was an astronomer?
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Raj,Uh.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Isabella,I understand. Time to go.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Raj,"No, p-please don’t."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Isabella,"It’s okay, Rajesh, I’m a grown woman. I don’t have to waste my time with someone who’s embarrassed by me."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Howard,"I can keep this, right?"
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Raj,"Isabella. Isabella wait, wait, let me explain."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Isabella,"If you are embarrassed by what I do, why did you pursue me?"
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Raj,"I’m sorry. Honestly, I didn’t think your job would bother me, but I guess it did. And I hate myself for that. But there’s a lot of things about me that would totally embarrass you."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Isabella,I doubt that.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Raj,"Well, prepare to be mortified. I let my dog eat food out of my mouth, not because she likes it but because I do. Also, I know they’re pretty, but I’m scared of butterflies."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Howard,"Sorry, just passing through. I think this fell off your cart."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Raj,Come on. What do you say? Let me make it up to you.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Isabella,You’re very persistent.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Raj,It’s my one move.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Isabella,"Okay. This Sunday night, you may take me to dinner at a nice restaurant."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Raj,Great. Where would you like to go?
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Isabella,Your choice. It can be Pakistani food if you like.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Raj,"Excuse me, but I’m Indian."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The telescope room.,Isabella,And now you know how it feels.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The apartment.,Penny,"So, were you turned on even a little bit?"
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The apartment.,Amy,It was like being hit on by Rat Pack Pee-wee Herman.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The apartment.,Leonard,"I’m sorry, is that a yes?"
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The apartment.,Amy,No.
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Amy, I didn’t want it to come to this, but you have left me no choice but to employ the most passionate, seductive dance known to man. The flamenco."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The apartment.,Amy,"For God’s sake, you’re ridiculous."
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"You guys are aroused, right?"
Series 10,Episode 08,The Brain Bowl Incubation,The apartment.,Amy,That was a close one.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Bert,Thank you very much. Thanks.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Leonard,That is unbelievable. Good for Bert.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Howard,"Damn, the MacArthur Genius Grant."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Raj,Couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,Everything is stupid and I want to go home.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"That’s Sheldon’s way of saying he’s proud of Bert, too."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Howard,Ah.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Hey, it’s not even called the Genius Grant, it’s the MacArthur Fellowship. Just like it’s not Frankenstein, it’s Frankenstein’s Monster. Which brings us back to that hulking simpleton over there. And if anyone’s a genius, it’s me for the way I brought that full circle."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Leonard,How much money did he win?
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Raj,Over half a million dollars.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Leonard,Wow.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Howard,"And he doesn’t have to use it for research, he can do whatever he wants with it."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Oh, good, maybe he can build a nicer bridge to live under."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Howard,Here he comes.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Leonard,Right. Be polite.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,I know how to behave.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Howard,Do you?
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Raj,"Hey, congratulations Bert."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"Yeah, good for you."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Howard,That’s amazing.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Bert,"Thanks. I was as surprised as anybody. When they called and told me I won, I didn’t believe them. And then they said, no, you really won. And then I said, cool."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Someone call George R. R. Martin, this guy knows how to finish a story."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Bert,"I’ve gotten pretty good at telling it. Well, see ya."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Some genius. I zinged him with sarcasm, he didn’t even notice."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"I know, and it was the greatest sarcastic quip I’ve ever heard."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Well, aren’t you a peach."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,,Credits sequence.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Who leaves their bike in the hallway? You know, if I knew how to ride one, I’d steal it."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Ignore him, he’s just cranky because Bert from the geology lab won a big grant."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The stairwell.,Penny,"Oh, I heard him interviewed on the radio. You know, when they told him he won, he didn’t believe it, but then he did believe it. It was so funny."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,Who listens to the radio any more?
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The stairwell.,Amy,Bert is studying the way microbes in rocks can survive in extreme environmental conditions.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The stairwell.,Leonard,They say it could be a potential indicator of life on other planets.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The stairwell.,Penny,"You know what, I’ve met Bert. Isn’t he an indicator of life on other planets?"
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"You used to make those jokes about me. Now everything is Bert, Bert, Bert."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The stairwell.,Amy,"You know, Sheldon, maybe if you take the time to actually read Bert’s research, you’d be less bitter about him winning."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,You want me to read a geology paper?
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The stairwell.,Amy,"Honestly, I just want you to be quiet but I’m all out of taffy."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,You busy? There’s somebody out here who wants to meet you.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Who is it?
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Say hello to everybody’s little friend, remote control Stephen Hawking."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Where did you get that?
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,I found him in an old box.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Why would you buy it?
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,I didn’t buy it. I made it.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Last question. What is wrong with you?
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,What’s the big deal?
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Howie, it’s in poor taste."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"No, it’s not. Check it out, he says fun stuff."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Remote-control Hawking,"Hey good lookin’, want to go for a spin?"
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,His eyes also light up in the dark.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Leonard,It’s always fun watching him read someone else’s work.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Penny,It’s like scrolling through the emojis on my phone.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Yeh, why? Eh, why? Oh, that’s why."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Amy,Sounds like the night we had coitus.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"I hope you’re happy making me read this. Bert’s work is remarkable, and I’m more upset than ever. This is worse than when I had to admit that Cedric the Entertainer’s actually entertaining."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Amy,"Sheldon, it’s foolish to be angry that Bert’s work has merit."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Yeah, well I am angry. And you telling me not to be angry makes me angry. And do you know how hearing myself say the word angry over and over makes me feel?"
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Penny,"Ooh, ooh, ooh, angry?"
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Leonard,What are you doing?
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Penny,"I, I knew the answer. I got excited."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Hey, buddy, why don’t we go for a walk, so you can calm down."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Sheldon,That’s a good idea. I guess everyone’s having them now.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Hey, I’m trying to help you."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Fine. You can walk ahead of me and scare off the pigeons.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Leonard,"You just wave your arms a little and they fly away, it’s not…"
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Okay, Raj, I’m gonna show you something. Now, one of us thinks it’s offensive, the other thinks it’s hilarious and a great idea. But, I’m not going to tell you who likes it."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"This is tough, but I’m going to say it’s the guy who shows me YouTube videos of people getting hit in the nuts."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"You’re crazy. I’ve worked with Hawking. He’s got a great sense of humour, and I think he’d like it."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Okay, call him and show him. I dare you."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,I have no problem calling him.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Fine, then do it."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Fine, I will."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"While you’re bothering the world’s most famous scientist, be sure to show him how funny he looks getting stuck under our dishwasher."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,What’s this button do?
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Remote-control Hawking,"Gentlemen, start your wheelchairs."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,You laughed when that guy got hit in the nuts.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,I laughed because the guy was Leonard.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The park.,Sheldon,"I admire you, Leonard."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The park.,Leonard,"Really, why?"
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The park.,Sheldon,"You’re happy with who you are. You don’t get jealous of other people. Instead of being weighed down by ambition, you just float along like a dead body in a river."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The park.,Leonard,"I couldn’t just take the compliment. I had to ask why. You know, I do understand what you’re feeling. My brother and sister’s accomplishments have always been held over my head."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The park.,Sheldon,How did you deal with it?
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The park.,Leonard,"I wet the bed until college, but I don’t think that’s a quality fix."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The park.,Sheldon,"I can’t believe I was surpassed by a geologist. I mean, rocks. He studies rocks. If rock is so great, how come paper beats it? Leonard, I’m having a primal urge to throw this rock."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The park.,Leonard,"Do it. Visualize it as your anger and, and toss it out of your life."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The park.,Sheldon,Perhaps I will. This rock encapsulates all my negative emotions. I will cast you far away. Feel free to take out a pigeon while you’re at it.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The park.,Leonard,Let it fly.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow…"
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Amy,What happened?
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Sheldon,I tried to let go of anger and threw a rock into my foot.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Leonard,Then he got more angry and kicked the rock with his other foot.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Penny,"Well, and what happened to you?"
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, I laughed so hard, I burst a blood vessel in my nose. It’s fine."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Amy,"You know, it’s one thing to be envious, but now you’re injuring yourself. It has to stop."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Although if you are gonna do it again, please let me know, so I can get it on video."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Amy,"You know, Sheldon, instead of fixating on what Bert has, you should appreciate all of the good things in your life. You’ve got love, you’re in good health, you’ve got a roof over your head."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Yeah, but you’ve got all those things, and no one’s lining up to be you."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Amy,Anybody else want to try? I’m gonna go make some more tea and question my life choices.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Leonard,You’re up.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Penny,"This is getting old fast, Dolores, knock it off."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Uh, do you really think calling me names is helpful?"
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Penny,"I do, your life is fine you big baby."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Maybe you’re right.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Amy,Really?
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Leonard,"If it helps, I’m questioning your life choices, too."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Thank you, Penny. You know, I just need to keep reminding myself that Bert’s success is not my failure."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Penny,There you go.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Sheldon,And that men of his large stature are more susceptible to a wide array of life-threatening diseases.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Penny,There you go.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,Outside Amy’s lab. Howard knocks on the door.,Amy,What’s up?
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,Outside Amy’s lab. Howard knocks on the door.,Howard,I’m conducting a quick survey. Do you think this respectful and loving tribute to a great man is in poor taste?
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,Outside Amy’s lab. Howard knocks on the door.,Amy,Yep.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Howard,Do you think this is in poor taste?
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Leonard,Does it spin around and do tricks?
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Howard,Yeah
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Leonard,Then yeah.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,Barry Kripke’s office.,Howard,What do you think?
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,Barry Kripke’s office.,Barry,"That is hiwawious. Give me the wemote contwol, I want to dwive him into the girls’ westwoom."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,Barry Kripke’s office.,Howard,"All right, we’re done. It’s offensive."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Top of the afternoon, gentlemen."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Howard,You’re in a good mood.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Well, it’s a new day. I have a new outlook. You know, I realized I don’t need to worry about other people. I just need to think more about myself."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"Oh, how will we ever get used to the new you?"
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Raj,"Well, I’m glad to see you moving forward."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Bert did quality research, and he deserves whatever accolades he receives."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Howard,What is going on? Did you upgrade his software last night?
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Leonard,I think he might be learning on his own.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Raj,Then the robot uprising has begun.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Excuse me, I need to pay Bert a proper congratulations."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Raj,"He doesn’t just look like C-3PO, now he walks like him."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Bert? I wanted to let you know that I read your research, and your award is well-deserved."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Bert,"Thanks. I’ve been hearing that a lot. Ever since I won, people think I’m great."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Well, just this once, you can count me as people, too."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Bert,"You know, as a MacArthur Grant winner, I’m allowed to nominate someone for next year."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,Really? I didn’t know that.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Bert,"So I was thinking, you know, engineers don’t get a lot of respect. Is your friend Howard working on anything cool?"
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"You know, I’m not sure. You know, you’d have to ask him. Excuse me.(Off)Aah. Leonard, I hurt myself again."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"Excuse me, I have to go take some pictures."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Amy,I can’t believe you head-butted a water fountain.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"No, I went to punch the water fountain, slipped in water in front of the water fountain, and hit my head on the water fountain."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Bernadette,I can’t imagine you being violent.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Leonard,"It’s not hard. Just picture the Three Stooges, and then take away two stooges."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Sheldon,I’m so disappointed in myself. Jealousy is completely illogical.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Raj,"It’s a human emotion, Sheldon. Everyone gets jealous. I’m jealous of Leonard and Penny and Howard and Bernadette for being in such happy relationships."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Amy,What about me and Sheldon?
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Raj,Sure.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Leonard,I’ve always been jealous of how much money Raj’s family has.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Raj,"Thank you for saying that. Next to buying things, that is the best part about having money."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Amy,"Ever since I met Penny, I’ve been envious of her looks."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Penny,"Aw, thank you."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Amy,That’s why I was so happy when you cut your hair off.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Penny,What?
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Amy,"You know what I mean. You were still hot, but more like a why’d that hot girl cut off all her hair, hot."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Penny,"You liked my short hair, right?"
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Yeah. I loved it. Love you, love the hair, would love to change the subject."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Penny,"Seriously, none of you liked it?"
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Bernadette,I thought it was brave. Does that count as liking it?
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Penny,"You know, how come nobody’s talking about Howard’s dopey haircut?"
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Bernadette,I think he looks cute.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Howard,And I think you’re cute.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Raj,I think you’re both cute.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Penny,I think I hate all of you nerds.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,A corridor at the university.,Sheldon,Sorry I’m moving slowly.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,A corridor at the university.,Leonard,"Oh, I don’t mind. If you pull a butterscotch out of your pocket, it would be like I’m walking with my grandma."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,A corridor at the university.,Sheldon,"Oh, no. A plaque? Nobody wants to see this."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,A corridor at the university.,Leonard,"Well, change plaque to mixed-race couple and you are my grandma."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,A corridor at the university.,Sheldon,"I can’t take this any more.(Knock, knock, knock)Bert.(Knock, knock, knock)Bert.(Knock, knock, knock)Bert."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,A corridor at the university.,Bert,Come in.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,A corridor at the university.,Sheldon,"All right, let’s do this, Bert? We need to talk."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,A corridor at the university.,Bert,What happened to you?
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,A corridor at the university.,Sheldon,"Rock, rock, water fountain. I am not proud of this, but I have been envious of your recent success."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,A corridor at the university.,Bert,"Wow, I won the MacArthur Grant, everyone’s jealous of me. Once I get Lasik, I’ll be out of things to wish for."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,A corridor at the university.,Sheldon,"I was hoping by admitting my weakness to you, I’d somehow be unburdened."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,A corridor at the university.,Bert,Is it working?
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,A corridor at the university.,Sheldon,"No. Now that you know my weakness, I hate you more than ever."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,A corridor at the university.,Bert,"Well, you know, we’re both pretty smart. I bet if we put our heads together, we could come up with a solution."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,A corridor at the university.,Sheldon,"We, hang on, you’re my enemy. Now, the enemy of the enemy is my friend. And right now, I’m my own worst enemy. That makes you my friend. Okay, I’m good to go."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,A corridor at the university.,Bert,"Great. Now that we’re friends, want to see if we can get tickets to a taping of Ellen?"
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,A corridor at the university.,Sheldon,You know what? This isn’t gonna work.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,A corridor at the university.,Bert,"Sheldon, wait. You know, you’ve got a lot to be happy about. You’re at the top of your field, you have a great girlfriend."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,A corridor at the university.,Sheldon,"Yes, that’s right. I have Amy. In the past, you’ve professed feelings for her. Does it eat you up inside that I have her and you don’t?"
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,A corridor at the university.,Bert,"It used to. But now that I’m rich and successful, I think I can do better."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Penny,I can’t believe you punched Bert.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"I didn’t punch him. He turned around, and I gave him a Captain Kirk karate chop. I’m not even sure he knows I did it."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon, I’ve got someone here who might make you feel better."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Stephen Hawking(on skype),"Hello, Sheldon."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Professor Hawking.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Hawking,I understand you’re struggling with professional jealousy.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Thanks, Leonard, now he’s not gonna think I’m cool."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Hawking,"Don’t worry, I know how you feel. I have never won a Nobel Prize."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Penny,"Oh, wow, that doesn’t seem fair."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Hawking,It’s fine. I’ve been on The Simpsons.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Sheldon,How do you deal with the success of your colleagues?
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Hawking,"I remind myself every scientific advancement is a victory. Also, I was on Star Trek."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, it was a good one. He played poker with Sir Isaac, you don’t care."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Hawking,"Don’t waste your time on jealousy Sheldon, you’re too brilliant."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Amy,How can you feel bad if Stephen Hawking says you’re brilliant?
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"I can’t. Thank you, Professor Hawking. You are a gift to mankind. There should be statues of you everywhere. You know, the Lincoln Memorial has a big chair. We could swap you right in."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Hawking,I always thought a motorized toy of me would be cool.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"What a wonderful idea, how does this man not have a Nobel?"
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Leonard,Do not tell Wolowitz.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The apartment.,Amy,Way ahead of you.
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The Ellen Show.,Ellen,"A new study came out, and it said that laughing makes your brain work better. And I know that’s true because laughing has made me the smartiest. Although, on the other hand, babies laugh a lot, and they’re dumb."
Series 10,Episode 09,The Geology Elevation,The Ellen Show.,Sheldon,Do people know about her? ‘Cause she’s delightful.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"If we’re going to be staying in this apartment, would you be interested in doing a little redecorating?"
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, actually, I would."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Great, what’d you have in mind?"
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,Let’s take every single thing from the other apartment and put it in here.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Well, how about we start a little smaller? Like moving the furniture around."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"You know, I have always thought that this couch would look fantastic on the curb in front of the building."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Look, we can’t just throw away Penny’s stuff, but we can ask if she wants any of it back."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"You know, I wonder how she feels about all this artwork."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Well, I’m sure she misses this one. I mean, it’s the greatest gift I’ve ever given anybody."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,It truly does capture the beauty of your friendship with Penny.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,It may have appreciated in value. The artist killed himself shortly after painting that.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Yeah, it seems only right that she have it back."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,I can’t wait to see the look on her face when I give it to her again.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,At the apartment door.,Sheldon,"Look, it’s the same smile she has in the painting."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,At the apartment door.,,Credits sequence.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Yeah, there’s hooks in the closet, I can hang it right now."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Penny,"Oh, no, no, those hooks are gone."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,What happened to them?
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Penny,"Uh, we ran out of candy on Halloween, I was just giving everything away."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,"Hey, guys, what are you, oh, that’s here, cool."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Penny,Amy wants me to have it.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Amy,"Well, it would be selfish of me to keep it."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Penny,But it’s a picture of you.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Amy,And you.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Penny,But you commissioned it.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Amy,To give to you.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Penny,But you like it so much.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Amy,So do you.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Penny,I seem to be losing.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,"Yes, you do."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,"You know, Leonard, the more I think about it, there are a number of mutually owned items in this apartment that you and I should go through. Uh, for example, who gets our beloved sword, Longclaw?"
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Penny,Why don’t you keep it?
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,"That seems fair, we did just give you the painting."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Penny,"Yeah, I don’t need anything around that I can stab myself with."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Wonderful, Longclaw is mine. And how about you keep our avocado plant?"
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,"Sounds right, a limited edition collectible worth hundreds of dollars and a thing that grew out of a thing we fished from the trash."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Although, Amy and I did just move in together, and a plant is a lovely housewarming gift."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,"Fine, take the plant."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, we got a sword and a plant, our apartment’s really shaping up."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Stuart, you didn’t have to get us a baby gift."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,"Oh. Just homemade coupons for things you might need help with before the baby gets here. Going to the grocery store, driving you to the doctor, if you’re not in a hurry I can dig you a koi pond."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,A foot massage?
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,"And that’s not me being creepy, that’s for either of you."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"This is very nice Stuart, thank you."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,How come this one’s on the back of an eviction notice?
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,"Oh, yeah. Uh, now that you mention it, can I live here?"
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Stuart, we’d love to help you out, but this a bad time, we’re about to have a baby."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,"Or is that why this is a great time? Think about it, when that baby comes you’re gonna need all the help you can get."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Thank you, but I’m not really sure."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Hang on, maybe it’s not the worst idea. I mean, he did do a good job taking care of my mother."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,That woman didn’t get heat rash once with me on powder patrol.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,I guess you could stay for a few days and we’ll see how it goes.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,"Thank you. And it’s only temporary, just till I get back on my feet, or the baby goes off to college, whichever happens first."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,When would you move in?
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,"Well, uh, my car broke down in your driveway, so I’m gonna say now. But I am ready to be helpful. In fact, I’m gonna go vacuum."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Hmm. Actually I just did that this morning.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,"Okay, then I’ll dust."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"I did that, too."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,Then I’ll check the batteries in the smoke detectors.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Howard just did that.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Yeah, let him do it."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,Oh. Remember when we got this at Comic-Con?
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, yeah. The Mr. Spock cuckoo clock."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Mr Spock Cuckoo Clock,Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,It’s one of a kind.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Penny,So if it breaks there’d be none of it?
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, Leonard, you know, who should keep this? On the one hand, I love Mr. Spock more than you do. On the other hand, I care more about clocks than you do."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,So you think you should keep it?
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,I’ll be right across the hall. You’ll probably be able to hear it.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,"Keep the clock, Sheldon."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,Thank you.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Penny,Thank you.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Amy,Thank you?
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, now, what about our 3-D chess set?"
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,"Let me guess, you want it."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, no, I just didn’t think you’d want a physical reminder of a game you never managed to win. As a kindness, I should probably take all the games."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,"You know what, Sheldon, take it. In fact, you can have everything, I really don’t care."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,Are you sure? These items represent our shared times together.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,"Well, now they’re yours."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Penny,Leonard.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,"Well, you know what’s gonna happen, he’s just gonna come up with some reason why everything should be his."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,"For a man so good at predicting my moves, how come you stink at 3-D chess?"
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Amy,"Sheldon, you’re, you’re being a little selfish. Why don’t you let Leonard keep a few things?"
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,"It’s not my fault I’m bad at sharing, I skipped kindergarten."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,You know what? There is one thing I would like.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Yeah, take whatever you want."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,I would like to keep the official flag of our apartment.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,But you don’t even like flags.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,"Yeah, I like this one."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,But I designed it.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,But you made me order it because you were too well-known in the flag community and they’d jack up the price.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,But you don’t even understand its symbolism.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, I do. The, the field of blue represents you being miserable, and the lion sticking its tongue out means I’m happy about it."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Come along, Amy. I know when I’m not wanted."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Amy,"I don’t think you do, but all right."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Bernadette,"Stuart, you cooked?"
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Howard,How did you know it wasn’t me?
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Bernadette,"There’s only three people in this house, and you’d still be my fifth guess."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Howard(door bell rings),That’s Raj.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Stuart,"You guys relax, I’ll get it. Have some bread while it’s still warm."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Howard,It’s like we have a butler. If I had a Batsuit I’d be Bruce Wayne.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Bernadette,You have a Batsuit.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Howard,"It’s pajamas, there’s no cape."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Stuart,"Hey, Raj."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Raj,"Hey, Stuart. What are you doing here?"
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Stuart,"Oh, I’m living here again."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Raj,"Do, uh, Howard and Bernadette know? Or is it like a possum in the walls kind of thing?"
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Stuart,"No, I needed a place to stay and, with the baby coming, I figured they could use some extra help."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Raj,"Okay, cool."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Stuart,"Anyway, come on in, dinner’s ready."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Raj,"Oh, but I bought Chinese takeout."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Stuart,"Oh, okay. Well, if Bernadette wants her ankles to swell up even more, she can have that."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,Is the Wi-Fi working for you?
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Penny,"Uh, hang on. I don’t think so, I’m clicking on one weird trick for a flat belly, but I’m still seeing celebrities who look like their pets."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, I knew it, Sheldon changed the password."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Penny,Are you sure?
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,"Well, the new network name is ha ha ha, now I’ve got you, so it’s either Sheldon or Gargamel from The Smurfs."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Penny,What a jerk.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,"You’re good at revenge, how do we get him back?"
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Penny,"Well, my go-to move is usually sleep with the person’s boyfriend, but I kind of feel like I’m already doing that."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,"Sheldon, I know what you did, now change the password back."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, powder me in sugar and call me a doughnut, if it isn’t Leonard Hofstadter."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,"Sheldon, I’m warning you, I can play this game, too."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,"If it’s like your 3-D chess game, then you’re out of your length, width and depth. Amy, get the Neosporin, somebody just got burned."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,"All right, I tried."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,"All right, I tried. That should be the title of your autobiography. Ooh, a second-degree burn."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Amy,I’ve got the Neosporin. Who got hurt?
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,It’s a good thing you’re cute.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Raj,"So, I was reading how it’s a good idea for new parents to take an infant CPR class."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Bernadette,"Yeah, we’ve been meaning to do that."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Stuart,"Oh, I know a CPR instructor who’ll come to the house."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Howard,That’d be great.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Stuart,I’ll give him a call. We met when I was sleeping on the beach and he thought I was dead.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Bernadette,Thank you again for cooking. It’s getting tough for me to be on my feet all day.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Stuart,"You just kick back and relax, I’ve got it all under control."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Raj,Although it was already under control.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Stuart,"I’m sorry, you mumbled something?"
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Raj,It’s just that they’ve had plenty of help.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Stuart,"Well, you know what they say, it takes a village."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Raj,"Well, they already had a village."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Stuart,I noticed the village couldn’t find time to put the crib together.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Raj,"Yeah, well, maybe the village was too busy checking out the local Montessori school for the new arrival."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Stuart,"You mean the one with the empty beer bottles in the sandbox? We’ll pass, thank you."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s dining room.,Bernadette,"Do something, Batman."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The laundry room.,Leonard,Hey.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The laundry room.,Sheldon,What do you think you’re doing?
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The laundry room.,Leonard,Separating my delicates.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The laundry room.,Sheldon,This is the level you’re stooping to.

Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadett’s house.,Raj,Why are you being like this?
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadett’s house.,Stuart,"Because I love Howard and Bernadette and if I want to keep mooching off them, I need to be helpful."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadett’s house.,Raj,"Hey, this pregnancy had an emotionally-needy third wheel way before you came along."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadett’s house.,Stuart,Why can’t there be four wheels?
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadett’s house.,Raj,"Is this what you do when I’m not here, make really good points?"
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadett’s house.,Stuart,"Look, just come in and help me build a baby swing."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadett’s house.,Raj,Thank you.

Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The stairwell.,Penny,"I think I’m gonna go for a run, you want to come?"
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The stairwell.,Leonard,"No, last time that old lady in the park kept screaming, watch out, he’s right behind you. Hello?"
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The stairwell.,Strange old man,"Hey, how you doing?"

Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The stairwell.,Penny,"What, what are you doing in our apartment?"
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The stairwell.,Strange old man,"Oh, I rented a room from your neighbour, the tall guy dressed like a little boy."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Unbelievable. Okay, uh, I don’t know what he told you, but you can’t stay here."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"So, there are fresh linens on the bed and, oh, well, now, I see you’ve met Theodore. Theodore, these are your new room mates, Leonard and Penny. They’re very honest, but I would not leave cash lying around."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Sheldon, what do you think you’re doing?"
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"My room is paid up until the end of the month, so I can do with it whatever I please, which includes renting it out for a dollar a night."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The stairwell.,Theodore,It’s like the ’40s again.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Anyway, I’ll leave you be. I have to, oh, oh, he’s expecting a newspaper in the morning. Apparently, they still make them."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The stairwell.,Penny,"All right, Sheldon, this is over the line."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"That’s true, but had I done something under the line, there wouldn’t be a man in your kitchen who can’t produce a single form of ID."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The stairwell.,Theodore,"Oh, oh, I have a receipt from a blood bank. I’m O-negative."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The stairwell.,Sheldon,And now you know as much about him as I do.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Raj,"Oh, hey, Bernadette, the swing comes with two different mobiles. The giraffes are pretty cute, what do you think?"
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Bernadette,"Great, go with the giraffes."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Stuart,Although the high contrast of zebra stripes might provide better stimulus for a developing baby.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Bernadette,"Yeah, you’re probably right, go with the zebras."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Stuart,"Good choice, boss."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Raj,At least my nose is naturally brown.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Bernadette,"Hey, could you please go to the market for me?"
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Howard,Get Stuart or Raj to do it.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Bernadette,"Howie, they’ve been doing everything for you."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Howard,"Mm, I know. It’s really making me lose respect for both of them."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Bernadette,Please just go to the store.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Howard,Fine. Who wants to drive me to the store?
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Raj(off),Me
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Stuart(off),I’ll do it.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Bernadette,Take Raj. Stuart is supposed to paint my toenails.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Penny,What do you think? Should we go to a hotel?
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,And just leave him here alone?
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Penny,"Okay, I’ll go to a hotel. Text me in the morning if you’re still alive."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,"Uh, Theodore, how long are you planning to stay exactly?"
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Theodore,"Oh, thanks to the coins I found in your couch, a day longer than I thought."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,This is ridiculous.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Theodore,I like the painting. Is that your mom?
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,"Sheldon, get out here."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,Will you keep it down? What kind of vengeful bed and breakfast do you think I’m running?
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,We lived together 13 years. How can you be so awful to me?
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,I’m being awful? You’re the one who went out of your way to hurt me.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,Because you were being selfish.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,Dividing our belongings is difficult.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,Why? I said I didn’t care.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Theodore,"Excuse me. It’s none of my business, but it sounds like a lot of this anger is coming from love."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,"Yeah, thanks, but nobody asked you."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Theodore,"Well, I’m just gonna keep on talking. Seems like, with Sheldon moving out, you’re in a new phase of your lives and it’s easier to fight than to face the feelings that you have for one another."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Amy,"I think he might be right. Also, who is that?"
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,"I have to admit, leaving you to move in with Amy has been harder than I thought it would be."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,"Well, for me, too. It’s not the same with you gone."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Theodore,If you’re looking for a new guy to live with.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,No.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Penny,"We’re good, thank you."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Amy,"So, no one’s gonna tell me? Okay."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Leonard, I would like us to stop fighting about our possessions."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,"Well, I’d like that, too."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,"In fact, I want you to keep the apartment flag, and I’m not just saying that because it touched your genitals."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,You promise?
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Sheldon,"I do. And to show you that there are no hard feelings, I am willing to rub my genitals on it as well."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Theodore,"Well if we’re rubbing genitals on things, that’s where I shine."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Penny,Little lower to the left. A little more.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,Good?
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Penny,"No, still hideous."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Leonard,"Well, I’m sure at some point, we won’t even notice it’s there."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Penny,"Yeah, you’d think that, but after a while it starts showing up in your dreams."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,The apartment.,Theodore,I think it brings the room together.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Howard,"Hey, tomorrow who wants to paint the nursery?"
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Raj,I’ll do it.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Stuart,Why do you get to do it? I’m the artist.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Raj,Just because you’re starving doesn’t make you an artist.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Stuart,Just because I look sickly doesn’t mean I’m starving.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Bernadette(off),Howard!
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Howard,"Guys, you heard her, go see what she wants."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Bernadette,I think I’m in labour.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Howard,"Oh, oh, okay, okay, uh, uh, uh, I can do this. We have a plan. Somebody please tell me the plan."
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Stuart,I’ll get the hospital bag.
Series 10,Episode 10,The Property Division Collision,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Raj,I’ll pull the van up.

Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Howard and Bernadette’s van.,Raj,"All right, hold on. I’m gonna drive like we do in India. Get out of my way, you syphilitic dogs."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Howard and Bernadette’s van.,Howard,"Stop that, this isn’t India."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Howard and Bernadette’s van.,Raj,Fine. What do one point three billion people know about having babies?
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Howard and Bernadette’s van.,Howard,Sorry. I know you were just trying to help. I love you.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Howard and Bernadette’s van.,Raj,"I love you, too. We’re good."

Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,Amy? Wake up.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,What’s wrong?
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,It’s midnight. Happy birthday.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,"Sheldon. Okay, you can have this back in the morning."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"This is for you. I was going to wrap it, but touching Scotch tape gives me the heebie-jeebies."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,I’ll put in on the list with peaches and felt. What is this?
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,A functional MRI of my brain. I did Sudoku before they took it so I’d be ripped.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,I love it. Thank you.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,And it’s not just an MRI. The orbitofrontal cortex is lit up because I was thinking of you.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,Sheldon.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,We seem to be moving on to the annual coitus portion of your birthday festivities.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,Is that okay?
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,I didn’t put on my come-hither plaid PJ’s for nothing.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,"You hate Scotch tape, but you love Scotch plaid. You are a mystery."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Penny(off),"Guys, wake up. Bernadette’s having her baby."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Leonard(off),"Come on, we’re going to the hospital."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,"I guess, I guess we should stop."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"Yeah. I’m afraid so. Childbirth, looming coitus? This is a banner night for female genitals."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,A delivery room.,Midwife,"Now I see three of you. Do we know the father, or is this some Mamma Mia nonsense?"
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,A delivery room.,Howard,I’m the father.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,A delivery room.,Midwife,"Okay, Dad, how far apart are the contractions?"
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,A delivery room.,Howard,No idea. Ask him.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,A delivery room.,Raj,12 minutes.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,A delivery room.,Midwife,12 minutes? Why are you here?
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,A delivery room.,Stuart,Aren’t we supposed to get here an hour and a half early?
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,A delivery room.,Midwife,"This is a hospital, not the airport."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,A delivery room.,Bernadette,I’m sorry. It’s our first time.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,A delivery room.,Midwife,It’s okay. This little one will be here before you know it. Do we know what we’re having?
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,A delivery room.,Howard,"No, we’re keeping it a surprise."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,A delivery room.,Midwife,Old school. Nice.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,A delivery room.,Bernadette,Not that old school. He knows.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,A delivery room.,Raj,"You see, I was at the doctor’s office, the folder was right there, so I took a peek."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,A delivery room.,Howard,And talking like this doesn’t make it less creepy.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,A delivery room.,Midwife,"Sweetheart, go home. Come back when the contractions are five minutes apart for an hour."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,A delivery room.,Raj,"I’m sorry, that’s ambiguous. Is it five minutes apart starting at the top of the hour, or five minutes apart starting with the first contraction, so essentially, like, 65 minutes?"
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,A delivery room.,Midwife,"I’m just throwing this out there, but home births are very popular these days."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Penny,"Sheldon, what took you so long?"
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Sheldon,Wolowitz might hand out cigars. I had to find my bubble gum cigar so I could join in without looking foolish.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Damn, I need my inhaler."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Amy,Just don’t smoke.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Leonard,"No, I went down the stairs too fast."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Penny(answering phone),Hey.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Raj,Don’t come to the hospital. We’re headed home.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Penny,"Oh, that was fast. Did she sneeze the baby out?"
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Bernadette,We showed up too early. We’ll keep you posted.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Penny,"Okay, well, we’ll talk to you guys later. Bye. She said not to come. It’s gonna be a while."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Amy,"Well, first deliveries can be slow."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Sheldon,I’m starting to rethink the Flash onesie I bought this kid.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Leonard,"I found it, but it’s empty."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Penny,"Well, it doesn’t matter. We’re not going to the hospital now."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Leonard,Are you sure? I’d really like to.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Amy,"Well, should we, uh, head back up?"
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Penny,"Well while we’re all awake, why don’t we go to a diner or something?"
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Amy,"Oh, uh, I don’t know. Sheldon, you don’t want to do that, do you?"
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"It doesn’t matter what I want. It’s your birthday, you decide."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Penny,"Oh, my God. It’s your birthday. Let’s do something fun."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Amy,Uh.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Penny,We could go to a bar.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Amy,Well.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Okay, I can breathe again. Babe, they want to have sex."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Penny,"Oh, of course. The annual birthday booty spectacular!"
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"That’s a bit childish, isn’t it?"
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Penny,"I’m sorry, and what flavour is your bubble gum cigar?"
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Sheldon,Grape. I find it the most mild.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Penny,"All right, well, you two go have fun."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Leonard,"If we find my backup inhaler, maybe we can get frisky."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Penny,"Oh, you sexy, wheezy little man."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Do you really need to record this?
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"You’ll be happy I did. Okay, little one, here we are back at home because you weren’t quite ready to come out yet. You wanted to make an entrance. I get it. And here’s your daddy. When he tries to tell you he used to be cool, you can see he wasn’t."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"All right, enough with the camera."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"Well, this is not for me, this is for the baby. Some day she’s gonna want to see this."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"I’m sorry, who’s gonna want to see this?"
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"I, I said she, but lot’s of things are she, boats and cars, whales, like thar she blows!"
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,You’re doing great.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Raj.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"Well, okay, I’m gonna sign off now. This next part may contain some adult language."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,How could you?
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"We made it this far without knowing, and you’ve ruined it."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"Well, you guys have no idea how hard it is to know something like this and not say it."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,"You told me it was a girl, and I didn’t say it."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Raj.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,You were supposed to keep that to yourself.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,"Oh, yeah. I guess it is hard."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,"So, where were we?"
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"Well, I believe we were kissing like randy teenagers, and your nose was whistling ever so slightly."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,I’m sorry.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"Oh, don’t be. You were like a foxy tea kettle."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,"Well, shall we start over?"
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,Very well.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,What’s wrong?
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"I’m not sure. Earlier tonight, things began organically, and now it’s feeling forced, like all the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,"Okay, that makes sense. I mean, the mood’s a little different now. We, we don’t have to rush."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"Oh, I know, but just, Leonard and Penny think we’re doing it, and I don’t want to disappoint them."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,And the mood continues to change.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"No, and also, I don’t want to disappoint you. I, you know, come on, it’s your birthday. I can soldier through this."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,Hold on. I think I might have a little surprise that might help get things back on track.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,Intriguing. Is back on track a hint that it has something to do with trains?
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,No.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"Because if it did have to do with trains, and you were gonna give…"
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,It’s not about trains.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,Not even a cozy sleeper car on the Orient Express?

Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The apartment.,Leonard,Hang on. I’m counting. It’s okay.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The apartment.,Raj(off),"Hello. Howard and Bernadette kicked me out because I told them they’re having a girl. Oopsy, I did it again."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The apartment.,Penny,"Maybe if we’re quiet, he’ll go away."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The apartment.,Raj,You’re gonna have to be quieter than that.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,Can I look yet?
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,"One second. All right, you can open your eyes. I thought I’d let Harry Potter make things hotter."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,Wowza.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,I got a Gryffindor robe for you.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"What, a Gryffindor sleeping with a Hufflepuff? How scandalous. You naughty girl, you went to the Wizarding World theme park without me."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,I did. Am I in trouble?
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"Yes, you’re in trouble, you went to Wizarding World without me."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,"Wait, what just happened?"
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,You know I’ve been wanting to go.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,"Sheldon, do you really want to argue with me on my birthday?"
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"Oh, you’re right. I’m sorry."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,Ooh. Happy birthday to me.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Raj(off),Hello.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,Is this about the baby?
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Raj,No. People just keep kicking me out everywhere I go.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,Good. Then you’re used to this.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Penny,"Hey, Bernadette’s water broke."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Leonard,"Come on, everyone to the hospital."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,You have got to be kidding me.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Howard and Bernadette’s van.,Howard,"Just try to relax, we’ll be there any minute. Stuart, stop driving like an old man. Speed it up a little."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Howard and Bernadette’s van.,Stuart,"I’m not an old man, I just can’t see at night."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Howard and Bernadette’s van.,Bernadette,"Here comes another one. Hey, Squinty, the gas pedal’s on the right."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Howard and Bernadette’s van.,Stuart,"All right, hang on. If you see any pedestrians, just call ’em out."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Leonard’s car.,Penny,Howard and Bernadette’s kid might be born on your birthday. How cool is that?
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Leonard’s car.,Amy,":21,369 –> 00:12:23,536"
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Leonard’s car.,,"Yeah, but I thought this"
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Leonard’s car.,,"baby was supposed to ruin their sex life, not mine."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Leonard’s car.,Raj,"This is not how I imagined this day going, I should be with them right now."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Leonard’s car.,Leonard,"Well, it is their child."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Leonard’s car.,Raj,"I know that. But to be fair, I’ve spent nine months helping Bernadette get ready for this baby, and Howard spent five minutes conceiving it. And I’m being generous."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Leonard’s car.,Sheldon,Five minutes? We must be doing it wrong. It took us hours.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Leonard’s car.,Raj,"And, and the worst part is that they kicked me out and let Stuart stay."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Leonard’s car.,Amy,"I understand, but this is a special day for them. Can you just try and let it go?"
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,Leonard’s car.,Sheldon,"She’s right. You know, I just learned Amy went to a theme park without me, but I’m not going to ruin her birthday. I’ll wait, and ruin 24 individual hours sprinkled throughout the year. Boop."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The delivery suite.,Howard,"Deep breaths, slow breaths."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The delivery suite.,Bernadette,I’m so thirsty. Give me more ice chips.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The delivery suite.,Stuart,Sorry. I thought these were room ice chips. I’ll go get some more.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The delivery suite.,Howard,"Uh, Stuart, while you’re out there, don’t come back."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The delivery suite.,Stuart,Okay.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The delivery suite.,Howard,"So, what are we gonna name this kid? Now that we know she’s a girl, it kind of ruins my plan for Wally Wolowitz."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The delivery suite.,Bernadette,We could name her after your mom.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The delivery suite.,Howard,Debbie? No. She hated that name.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The delivery suite.,Bernadette,Did she have a middle name?
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The delivery suite.,Howard,Melvina.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The delivery suite.,Bernadette,Let’s keep thinking.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The delivery suite.,Howard,Ah. It sucks that she’s not here.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The delivery suite.,Bernadette,I know.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The delivery suite.,Howard,Hm. She would’ve been the best grandma.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The delivery suite.,Bernadette,She did always have candy in her pocket.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The delivery suite.,Howard,Yeah. I was 20 years old before I figured out Tootsie Rolls weren’t naturally warm.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The delivery suite.,Bernadette,"I didn’t know her five minutes and she asked, are you a Milky Way or a Snickers girl?"
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The delivery suite.,Howard,"Thank God you answered right, we wouldn’t be here today."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Leonard,It’s hard to believe Howard’s having a kid.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Amy,"Yeah. Penny, you’re the one who introduced him to Bernie."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Penny,How many times do I have to say I’m sorry?
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Leonard,"It’s not just Howard and Bernadette. I mean, look how far we’ve all come."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Stuart,Hmm. You two got married.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Amy,Sheldon and I are living together.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Sheldon,"But if my mom asks, we have bunk beds."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Leonard,"Penny was a struggling actress when we met, and now she’s a successful pharmaceutical rep."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Penny,"Okay, you don’t have to say struggling every time. You can just say actress."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Stuart,Howard went to space.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Amy,Bernadette got her doctorate.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Leonard,"Sheldon, Howard and I are working with the government on our quantum gyroscope."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Amy,We’ve all come a long way. There’s a lot to be proud of.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Raj,"For God’s sake, just drive in the knife, why don’t you."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Stuart,What’s your problem?
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Raj,"Well, you’re all thinking it, I’m the only one who hasn’t done anything worthwhile."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Sheldon,"I was not thinking it. Although, now that you point it out, it is undeniable."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Stuart,"Raj, if it’s any consolation, I’m no better off than I was ten years ago."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Raj,"Oh, yay, I have a doctorate in astrophysics and I’m every bit as awesome as the pasty-faced owner of a comic book store."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Sheldon,"Raj, show some compassion. Those are things that we think but don’t say."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Raj,Excuse me.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Leonard,"Sorry, Stuart."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Stuart,"Hey, I’m in a hospital and I’m not the patient. I’m fine."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The delivery suite.,Howard,"Come on, Bernie, breathe. Remember what you learned in birthing class."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The delivery suite.,Bernadette,"I remember thinking this is stupid, and I was right."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The delivery suite.,Howard,Do you want me to get the nurse?
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The delivery suite.,Bernadette,"No. If one more person puts their fingers near my uterus, I’m gonna cross my legs and snap ’em off."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Leonard,I’ve come to peace with my relationship with my parents. That was a big milestone for me.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Sheldon,"Oh, speaking of personal growth, I recently tried eating Swiss chard. You know, I didn’t swallow it, but Amy said it counted."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Raj,Hey.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Stuart,Hey. Still a loser or did you turn things around while you were gone?
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Penny,"You know, Raj, honey, you’re being too hard on yourself. When I first met you, you couldn’t even talk to women. I mean, you couldn’t even talk if one was in the room."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Raj,"Oh, great, now I can say things like I can’t believe you’re breaking up with me, why are you breaking up with me? Yes, I’ll still help you move."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Penny,Anyone else want to try?
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Stuart,"Uh, yeah, I got something. Raj, not everybody could be a dog owner. Oh, what? Did your doggie break up with you too?"
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Penny,"Hey, I bought M&Ms at the vending machine and two bags came out."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Raj,"I bought the first one, it didn’t fall."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Penny,Here.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Howard,"She’s here, the baby’s here."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Penny,Oh!
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Raj,Congratulations.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Amy,How’s Bernadette?
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Howard,"Tired, but great. They’re both great."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Penny,Does the baby have a name yet?
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Howard,We have named her Halley.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Penny,– Oh.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Leonard,"Oh, like Halley’s comet."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Howard,"Exactly. Also like the comet, Bernadette said she’s not gonna have sex with me for another 75 years."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Amy,"That’s not a real thing, he’s just joking."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Howard,"I’m gonna get back. Thank you for staying up, I can’t wait for Halley to meet her new aunts and uncles and godfather."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Raj,Really?
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Howard,Of course.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The waiting room.,Raj,"You hear that, Stuart? I’ve got a dog and a godchild, you have nothing."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The hospital nursery.,Penny,"Oh, look at all the babies."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The hospital nursery.,Sheldon,"Some will be successful, some may be homeless. It’s fun to think about."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The hospital nursery.,,Leonard; I wonder which one’s Halley.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The hospital nursery.,Amy,Kind of hard to see the names.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The hospital nursery.,Penny,"Mm, that one kind of looks like Bernadette."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The hospital nursery.,Amy,They all look the same to me.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The hospital nursery.,Raj,"Guys, she’s my goddaughter, I think I’ll know when I see her. That one."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Amy,"Well, that was quite a day."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"It was. Bernadette had her baby, I made it to Wizarding World, and now it is time to complete your birthday celebration. Hankius pankius."
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Amy,I was afraid you’d be too tired.
Series 10,Episode 11,The Birthday Synchronicity,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Amy, I just saw a magic train and reported somebody for cutting the line. If that’s not foreplay, I don’t know what is."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Penny,"Hey, can you help me put some of the food out?"
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Leonard,Yeah. Let me finish packing this stuff up. You know how Sheldon is if he sees Christmas stuff lying around after New Year’s.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Penny,"Yeah, but he doesn’t live here anymore."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Well, he doesn’t live at Walmart, but he still threw a tantrum when he saw Marshmallow Peeps after Easter. And that’s the same man who complains you can’t find Marshmallow Peeps after Easter."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Penny(checking phone),"Oh. It’s Bernadette. She says they’re running late. The baby threw up on Howard, and then Howard threw up on Howard."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Well, he didn’t throw up on the baby. That’s a win."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Hello.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Amy,Hi.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Penny,Hi. Welcome back. How was Texas?
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, you know., the lone star state. Hmm. That should be its Yelp rating."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Amy,It was not a great trip.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Penny,"Well, you’re home now."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Yeah. It is good to be home. Oh, good lord, is that mistletoe? Don’t you maniacs own a calendar?"
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Penny,I told him to take it down. He would not listen to me.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,,Credits sequence.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Leonard,Did you at least have a good flight down there?
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"It was fine. Other than the weird-tasting juice Amy gave me, I slept the whole way."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Penny,"So, what happened in Texas that was so bad?"
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Leonard,"And before our next drive to Comic-Con, I need the name of that juice."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, we were on our way to my mother’s house…"
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,,Flashback.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,How did we get in the car?
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,,Back to apartment.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Leonard,Hold on. How did you get him in the car?
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Amy,"I rented one of those carts, pushed him toward the open door and just let inertia take care of the rest."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,,Flashback.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Amy,"So, while we’re at your mother’s house, it might be a good time to tell her that we’re living together."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Do we have to? I really don’t want to hear the religious lecture.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Amy,Maybe there won’t be one.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"There’s always one. She gave it to my sister about her boyfriend, my brother about his girlfriend, my father about his girlfriend. That one had some un-Christian words in it."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Amy,"Well, she likes me. You know, there’s a chance she might be okay with it."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Eh, I don’t know. I am her precious little boy. And you did take my flower."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,,Back to apartment.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Penny,Do boys have flowers?

Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Mary,"Thank you, God, for the food we are about to receive and for the nourishment of our bodies and bless the hands that prepared it. Amen."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Given that your hands prepared it, isn’t that a little self-serving?"
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Mary,"You start changing the words to the prayers, next thing you know, you’re in a church with a guitar."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Amy,"Thank you for cooking, it looks delicious."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Mary,"Oh, it’s my pleasure. Mm. I’m so glad y’all could make it. So, tell me, what’s going on back home?"
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Amy,"Well, uh, Howard and Bernadette had their baby."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Mary,"Oh, that’s wonderful. Now, have they decided to raise it Jewish or regular?"
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Welcome to Texas.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Amy,"They haven’t said. Anyway, we, uh, we also have some exciting news to share."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, wait, wait, shouldn’t we just eat? You know, I mean, God did take time out of his busy schedule to bless these Sloppy Joes."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Mary,"Come on, Shelly, tell me your news."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"All right. This is on you. Amy and I are living together in sin, like a couple of New Yorkers. Now, while you scold us, I’m going to get a knife and a fork. Joe may be sloppy, but Sheldon’s not."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Mary,"Well, thank you for letting me know, and I, for one, am thrilled."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"What? Wh, where’s the judgment? Wh, where’s the fire and brimstone? Where’s the part where you tell us we’re going to Hell and I say have you seen the size of the bugs outside? We’re already there."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Mary,"Obviously, I would prefer if you weren’t living out of wedlock, but given your special circumstances, I’m very happy for you."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,And what special circumstances are those?
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,,Back to apartment.

Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Mary,"Shelly, how do I put this? By your third birthday, you had memorized over a thousand different kinds of trains, and I never imagined a woman getting aboard any of them."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"What, so you thought I was going to be alone for the rest of my life?"
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Mary,No. Just for the middle part. ‘Cause at the end I assumed there’d be nurses.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, this is highly insulting."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Amy,"Sheldon, don’t overreact."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"I’m the child she was worried about? I have a brother and sister whose combined intellectual wattage couldn’t power a potato clock, if I spotted them the potato."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Amy,"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."

Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Amy,He’s been in there a long time. Should I go talk to him?
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Mary,He’s upset with me. I should be the one who talks to him.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Amy,Are you going to?
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Mary,"Oh, heck no."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Amy,"Sheldon, what, what are you doing?"
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Just being the unsocialised eccentric my mother always thought I was.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Mary,"You startin’ to see why I didn’t go in there? Sheldon, if you’re trying to prove me wrong, the tighty-whities on your head ain’t changing my mind."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Amy,"We’re ignoring the fins, okay."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Yeah. And I don’t understand why you’re taking her side. By being my girlfriend, she’s saying you’re a weirdo, too."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Amy,I don’t think that’s what she’s saying.

Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Amy,That’s exactly what she was saying.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Can you believe my mother thinks we’re both strange?
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Leonard,Absolutely not.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Penny,That’s too loud.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Leonard,Absolutely not.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Amy,"Well, after that, Sheldon and I got out of the house for a while."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, first we buttered my feet to get the swim fins off, and then we went out."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,,Flashback.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Amy,"You know, I’m sorry your mother made you feel bad. But, you know, at the end of the day, she was wrong, because you’re not alone."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"You’re right. I have Leonard and Howard and Raj, Stuart, Penny, Leonard’s mom, Bernadette, Wil Wheaton…"
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Amy,What about the woman who just buttered your big flat feet?
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"I was going chronologically. You’re right between Koothrappali’s father and Omar, the one-eyed Sparkletts guy."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Amy,"Well, let’s try to not let it ruin the rest of our trip."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,I knew we should’ve never mentioned us living together in the first place.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Amy,She was gonna find out eventually.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Disagree. We’ve known about evolution since 1859, she still believes in Noah and his amazing zoo boat. This could have all been avoided if you’d only listened to me."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Amy,"Sheldon, I knew your mother was fine with us living together because I already told her we were."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Why would you do that?

Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,You managed the situation?
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Amy,That’s right.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"So my mother thought I was incapable of finding a mate, and my mate thinks I’m incapable of running my own life."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Amy,"Not your whole life. I mean, science, you got that. Organizing your sock drawer, you’re the king. But understanding how other people are feeling, that’s a weak spot for you."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,I have gotten much better at that.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Amy,Have you? How am I feeling right now?
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,What? How should I know? Excited? Itchy? Give me the first letter.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Amy,"You and I are in a relationship. I help you with your shortcomings, and you help me with mine."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,How would you feel if I contacted your mother behind your back?
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Amy,Delighted that you showed any interest in my family at all?

Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Penny,Yeah. Go ahead.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Amy,Do you need help?
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Howard,"No. I got it. Doubtfire, Poppins, follow me."

Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Penny,"Stop. Okay. They told Mary they were living together, there was a fight, he got his feelings hurt, then he put underwear on his head."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Leonard,"On purpose, not the way it used to happen in high school."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,I was acting odd intentionally.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Bernadette,Really? So you can control it?
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Penny,Okay. Then what happened?
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, there’s really not much left to tell. I decided that my mother views me as a child because I never went through a rebellious phase, so, I got an earring.(Flashback to Sheldon screaming.)My mother made me take it out.(Flashback to Sheldon screaming.)Amy put alcohol on it.(Flashback to Sheldon screaming.)And here we are."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Howard,What did we miss?
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,The apartment.,Bernadette,I couldn’t explain it if I tried.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,"The same, later.",Penny,"So tell me, how did Sheldon look with an earring?"
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,"The same, later.",Amy,Like the pirate who helps the other pirates connect to the Internet.

Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,"The same, later.",Raj,"Oh, my God, what happened?"
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,"The same, later.",Leonard,"Well, we had started binge-watching Luke Cage together, and it was kind of our thing, and then I find out that she watched two episodes without me."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,"The same, later.",Bernadette,It’s like I was excited for a present and got socks.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,"The same, later.",Stuart,I don’t understand how that turns into the worst fight of your life.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,"The same, later.",Sheldon,I don’t understand what’s wrong with socks.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,"The same, later.",Penny,"To be fair, we may have been on edge because of the Christmas tree."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,"The same, later.",Howard,What happened

Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,"The same, later.",Penny,You do make a cute elf.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,"The same, later.",Leonard,"Oh, yeah? And you thought Spock ears were only good for Comic-Con."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,"The same, later.",Penny,"Hey, hey, I just found a farm where they let you chop down your own tree."

Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,"The same, later.",,Time lapse.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,"The same, later.",Leonard,Stupid idea.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,"The same, later.",Penny,"No, what’s stupid is a physicist who doesn’t understand when you swing an axe, you don’t let go."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,"The same, later.",Leonard,"For the tenth time, my mittens were slippery!"
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,"The same, later.",Penny,"Ugh. It’s 70 degrees, you didn’t need mittens."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,"The same, later.",Leonard,You know how easily I blister.
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,"The same, later.",Penny,"Yes, yes, you bruise, you peel. It’s like I’m married to an old piece of fruit."
Series 10,Episode 12,The Holiday Summation,"The same, later.",Leonard,"Look, we could keep fighting and let it ruin our night, or, or we can stop and try to salvage the evening."

Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Well Sheldon always has his pants on. I don’t think I could pick his knees out of a line-up.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Penny,"Well, it’s not just the pants, it’s just, it’s like since we got married he doesn’t really try any more."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Uh, Penny, I don’t know how to say this, but this is my first girls’ night and you’re kind of bumming everybody out."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"All right, got Halley to sleep."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"Yeah, i heard you on the baby monitor. Didn’t think you could think you could turn the theme from Walking Dead into a lullaby."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Yeah, got to get her hooked on TV or someday she’ll want me to play outside. Boy, that floor is so squeaky. I’m surprised I didn’t wake her up walking out of the room."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,Have you tried anything to fix it?
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Well, i put the rug down. It didn’t help."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"I know. Blue shag, what were you thinking?"
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,Did try nailing a couple of the boards down.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,Did that do anything?
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Yeah, it left little holes in the floor, that’s why I bought the rug."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Sheldon,"If you do that, i’ll win in eight moves. I’ll win in five moves. I’ll win in one move."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, no. Good game."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Penny,Hey.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Leonard,Hey.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, Penny, I’m trying to take an interest in other people. Uh, how was your girls’ night?"
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Penny,"Oh, it was fine."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Sheldon,Hmm. Did you have anything to eat?
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Penny,"Uh, chips."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Sheldon,Anything to drink?
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Penny,Some wine.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, I’m just playing tennis against the drapes here."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Leonard,Just ignore him.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Penny,Hm. At least he took an interest.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Leonard,What’s that supposed to mean?
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Penny,Nothing.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Leonard,"Hey, what’s going on with you?"
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Penny,I don’t want to talk about it.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Leonard,"Well, hey, come on, just tell me."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Penny,Fine. Lately I kind of feel like you’ve been taking me for granted.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Leonard,What? Where is this coming from?
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Leonard, she might be drunk. All she had was chips."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Penny,"It’s just, since we got married you seem to think you don’t have to try any more."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Leonard,That is ridiculous.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Penny,This is exactly why I didn’t want to talk about it.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Leonard,"No, no, no, no, let’s talk about it. I’m the one who’s made all the effort in this relationship since day one. Please tell me what more I could do?"
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Penny,"Okay, you know what? Maybe I’ll take Amy with me to the spa this weekend instead."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Leonard,"Fine, go ahead."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Amy is free. She had a harp lesson on Saturday but it got cancelled. Boy, when you take an interest in people, you really uncork a geyser of nonsense."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette (on phone),"Okay. Thanks, daddy. He said the only way to really fix an old floor like that is to tear it up and replace the whole thing."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,That sounds expensive.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"Hang on. No offence to her father, but he’s not an MIT trained engineer. Thinking and building is what you do."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"MIT’s motto is mind and hand, which just so happens was also my motto as a lonely teenager."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"Oh come on, we just need to be more creative. What if you didn’t step on the floor at all? Like, what if you swung on a rope from the ceiling?"
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,No.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"Okay, um, okay, what if you rig up a pulley system and move yourself across the room in a harness?"
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,No.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,I have one. What if you got a giant slingshot and flung yourself into the wall?
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,Is that supposed to be funny?
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"Hold on. Yeah, that’s funny."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Penny,"All right, we’re heading out."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Leonard,Mm-hmm.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Amy,I’ll call you when we get to the hotel.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Sheldon,And if they have any of those tiny bottles of shampoo?
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Amy,I will bring them home so you can show me how Godzilla takes a shower.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Leonard,Have fun.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Penny,Thanks. Are you ready?
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Amy,"Uh-huh. Bye, Sheldon."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Sheldon,You know what? I feel uncomfortable engaging in a public display of affection while their relationship is strained.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Leonard,"Go ahead, it’s fine."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Sheldon,Bye.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Amy,Bye.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Leonard,Okay.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Penny,Let’s go.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Amy,Bye.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Sheldon,Bye.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Amy,I’ll miss you.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Yeah, I’ll miss you too."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Amy,I’ll miss you more.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, if x equals the amount that you’ll miss me, then I’ll miss you x plus one."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Amy,"If you miss me x plus one, I’ll miss you open paren x plus one, close paren to the second…"
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Leonard,Thank you.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,"The apartment, later.",Sheldon,"Here. You’re sad, so I made you tea."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,"The apartment, later.",Leonard,Thanks.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,"The apartment, later.",Sheldon,And it’s just the way you like it.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,"The apartment, later.",Leonard,Earl grey?
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,"The apartment, later.",Sheldon,Yes.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,"The apartment, later.",Leonard,Honey?
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,"The apartment, later.",Sheldon,Yes.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,"The apartment, later.",Leonard,Unsweetened almond…
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,"The apartment, later.",Sheldon,"Good Lord, I made you tea, just drink it."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,"The apartment, later.",Leonard,"Sorry, thank you."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,"The apartment, later.",Sheldon,"Well, what can we do to cheer you up?"
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,"The apartment, later.",Leonard,I really don’t know.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,"The apartment, later.",Sheldon,"You want to play Jenga? Or, uh, Ticket to Ride? Hearthstone? What would you be the happiest losing at?"
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,"The apartment, later.",Leonard,"I don’t want to play a game, Sheldon."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,"The apartment, later.",Sheldon,"Wow, and I remember when you loved playing games with me. Maybe Penny isn’t the only relationship you’re phoning in."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,"The apartment, later.",Leonard,"Its not that I’d stopped trying, its just how relationships progress. They start with infatuation, but over time mellow into something more comfortable."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,"The apartment, later.",Sheldon,"Hmm. Yeah, you’re right. It’s like when I first encountered the Pythagorean theorem. You know, I was blown away that the square of the hypotenuse was the sum of the squares of the opposite sides. But now I’m just like, eh."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s nursery.,Howard,"Okay, this grid represents the room. All we need to do is plot out where each squeak is, and we can find a quiet path to the crib."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s nursery.,Raj,It looks like a map from Dungeons and Dragons.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s nursery.,Howard,Mm. Except the creature in the crib is a level-nine poop monster.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s nursery.,Raj,"Okay, uh, you check for squeaks, and I will mark them down."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s nursery.,Howard,"Okay, space A3, here we go. It’s squeaking. Mark it."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s nursery.,Raj,It’s nice to think that you grew up in this room and now your daughter’s going to as well.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s nursery.,Howard,Mm. I hope she has the same amount of sex in it I did. None. Next square.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s nursery.,Raj,Why do you bounce with your hands in the air like that?
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s nursery.,Howard,"It’s a tradition of my people.(Singing)If I were a rich man, ya ba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dum."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s nursery.,Raj,"Material Girl needs ot be retired, that is your karaoke song."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Leonards car.,Sheldon,Would you like to play a driving game I invented?
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Leonards car.,Leonard,Is it about the failing state of my relationship with Penny?
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Leonards car.,Sheldon,"Never mind. You know, Penny went to this spa to be away from you. Are you sure you should be going there?"
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Leonards car.,Leonard,I don’t want to wait two days for us to work this out.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Leonards car.,Sheldon,"Very well. You got married spur of the moment, I don’t see why your divorce should be any different."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Leonards car.,Leonard,"I would pull this car over and kick you out, but If Penny dumps me, you’re all I got."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Penny,When was the last time you got a massage?
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Amy,"Sheldon walked on my back two weeks ago, but that was just ’cause there was a spider on his pillow and he was trying to get away."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Penny,"Leonard stood on me once, too, but he was just trying to see the Rose Parade."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Amy,"I don’t know the protocol, are you gonna be naked for your massage?"
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Penny,"Well, yeah."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Amy,Hmm. Then this is probably too many clothes.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Leonard,Hey.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Penny,What are you doing here?
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Leonard,I came here to apologize.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Penny,"Okay. Leonard, I really appreciate that, but I need a little time to myself."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Leonard,"Okay. I don’t get it, you said make an effort, here I am making an effort."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Sheldon,"Hello, Amy. It’s nice to see you."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Amy,"Nice to see you, too."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Sheldon,And that’s how you make effort look effortless.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Penny,All right. Can you please just go and we’ll talk about this tomorrow?
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Leonard,I don’t understand what you want.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Penny,I’m trying to figure it out.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Sheldon,"You know what? If you’d like, I could whip up a quick relationship agreement. Well, I’m at a spa, I might as well do something relaxing."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Amy,"Sheldon, why don’t we give them some privacy?"
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Sheldon,"Very well. Hey, later we’ll check out the minibar, I’ll show you how Godzilla gets drunk."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s nursery.,Howard,"So, what we did was map out the entire room to identify every squeak. Watch. It’s easy,"
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s nursery.,,once you get the hang of it. Step. Step. Hop onto Ottoman.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s nursery.,Raj,"Don’t do that in socks, I almost broke my neck."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s nursery.,Howard,"Then simply sit, spin, stand, stretch, maybe in looser pants, then step, grab, tiny pivot, pull, and you’re there. Easy peasy, mac and… you get the idea."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s nursery.,Bernadette,You actually expect me to do this while holding a baby in the dark.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s nursery.,Raj,"Hold on, I don’t think she was impressed."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,Howard and Bernadette’s nursery.,Howard,"Bigger problems, I felt something pop."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Sheldon,There’s a cucumber in my water.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Amy,Uh-huh.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Sheldon,"Do they know it’s there? I mean, should I tell somebody?"
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Amy,It’s there on purpose. It’s refreshing.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Sheldon,"Interesting. The world’s most boring liquid and the world’s most boring vegetable, but you put ’em together and bleugh."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Leonard,Hey.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Penny,Hey.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Sheldon,"Oh good, you’re here. Are you still fighting? If you get divorced, do I get two Christmas’s?"
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Penny,We’re not getting divorced.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Leonard,"Listen, we realized, that, uh, we’re facing some new challenges as a married couple."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Penny,"Yeah. And there are a few things we need to stay on top of. So we thought it would useful, and I can’t believe I’m about to say this, um."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Leonard,"Would you please help us make a relationship agreement? But one that’s tailored to us, okay, we don’t need a bathroom schedule."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Penny,Although a rule about him texting me from in there might help with the romance.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Leonard,What do you say?
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Sheldon,"I get to write a contract? I say, let’s get this party of the first part started."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Penny(after Amy laughs),Do you really think that’s funny?
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The spa.,Amy,It’s in our agreement. I have to laugh.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Sheldon,"If you find this draft acceptable, then I believe your new relationship agreement is ready to be signed."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Penny,"Article 8, subsection B, Leonard will restrict videogaming in underpants to hours Penny is not home. This includes boxers, briefs, thongs, G-strings or anything else that calls attention to his pasty little thighs."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Leonard,Does it really need to say that?
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Sheldon,"I did this for free, let me get a little something."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Leonard,"Article 10, subsection C, if questioned Penny may not say that everything is fine if it isn’t. Other unacceptable responses include, it’s nothing, don’t worry about it, and, I said it’s nothing don’t worry about it."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Penny,I think this all looks good.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Leonard,"Me, too."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh well, great then, here, you sign here, date here, and Penny, if you could initial here to indicate that you’re accepting Leonard in as is condition."
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Amy,I remember signing our first relationship agreement.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Sheldon,Mm. You seem to be forgetting the no nostalgia clause.
Series 10,Episode 13,The Romance Recalibration,The apartment.,Amy,"Right, right. Got it."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Leonard,What’s going on with that woman you’re dating?
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Raj,I broke up with her.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Leonard,Why?
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Raj,She said she didn’t want to see me any more and I found that insulting.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Howard,I thought things were going well. What happened?
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Raj,"I don’t know, she didn’t even give me a reason."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"That’s not a problem, we can figure this out. What are the reasons women reject Raj?"
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Raj,Can we not play this game?
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,Doesn’t like games. That’s one.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Ignore him. Yeah, sorry about the breakup."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Raj,"That’s okay, I’m fine."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Of course you’re fine. Not every member of a species finds a mate. Sir Isaac Newton died a virgin, look at the contributions he made."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Raj,"I’m not a virgin, Sheldon."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"So now you think you’re better than Isaac Newton? Oh, no wonder women don’t like you."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Leonard,You’re not being very nice.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,What? He said he was fine.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Howard,Sometimes people say things they don’t mean.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Oh, that’s a paradox. I mean if you meant what you just said, then that means you may not have meant what you just said."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Careful, I saw this on Star Trek. Smoke’s gonna come out of his ears soon. Hey."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Penny,"Hey, boys. How’s it going?"
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Well, I thought we were having a nice conversation, but it turns out I was being offensive."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Bernadette,"So, normal."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,Yeah.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Amy,"Sheldon, what did you do?"
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"We were discussing Raj’s recent breakup and apparently, I was insensitive to him."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Raj,"It’s okay, I’m fine."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Don’t fall for it. He’ll get you to compare him to a dead virgin, and suddenly you’re the bad guy."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Raj,"Sheldon, when I said I was fine, I meant I didn’t want to talk about it any more."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,Then why didn’t you say that?
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Howard,Because that’s not what people do.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Well, I would prefer if people told me exactly what is on their mind."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Penny,"No. No, you don’t, you really don’t. I actually can’t say don’t enough."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Well, it certainly would be easier. You have no idea what it’s like to struggle with recognizing emotional cues."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Amy,I’m sure it’s extremely frustrating.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,Thank you.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Amy,And also a little sad.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Okay, now you’re just showing off."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Bernadette,"You know, I just read that a team at MIT. developed a device that helps people read human emotions."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Leonard,And you think we can get those guys to reprogram Sheldon? Cool.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Bernadette,"It’s supposed to be accurate, like, 85% of the time."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Penny,"Wow, I find that hard to believe."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Leonard,That a bunch of awkward scientists with no social skills would invent a machine to do it for them?
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Penny,I take it back. I believe it.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Howard,"You if it’s at MIT, I can make some calls. Maybe we can get Sheldon a prototype."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Amy,What do you think?
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,A machine that reads emotions is intriguing. It could help me be a more considerate friend.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Bernadette,Wouldn’t that be nice.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"It could also help me identify my enemies, discover their fears and then I could use those fears to destroy them."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,Bernadette,I like the first one.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The stairwell.,,Credits sequence.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The comic book store.,Raj,"Now that Sheldon’s across the hall, have you decided what you’re doing with his old room?"
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The comic book store.,Leonard,I was thinking maybe a library or a gaming room.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The comic book store.,Sheldon,You could make it a train room.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The comic book store.,Leonard,I don’t like trains. You like trains.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The comic book store.,Sheldon,"I know, and Amy says I can’t have a train room."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The comic book store.,Howard,"Sheldon, I just heard from the guys at MIT about that emotion reader. They’re sending a prototype for you to beta test."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The comic book store.,Sheldon,Wonderful. Although I’m not sure how I feel about being used as a guinea pig.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The comic book store.,Leonard,"Well, when you get the machine, you can find out."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The comic book store.,Raj,Maybe I could use it to understand why women keep dumping me.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The comic book store.,Howard,"Well, you don’t need a machine for that, just send a survey card to all your ex-girlfriends and tell them if they fill it out they might win a prize."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The comic book store.,Raj,"That’s actually not a bad idea. Maybe I could even get them all together, sort of like a, a focus group, to find out what’s wrong with me."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The comic book store.,Leonard,"No, Raj, that’s a terrible idea."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The comic book store.,Howard,"Yeah, I was joking."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The comic book store.,Sheldon,"Really? Uh, little tip: jokes are often better when you end them with wocka wocka or ha-cha-cha."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Hey, great news. The TV I want will fit in the gaming room, and if I leave the curtains open, I can watch it from work."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Penny,"Hey, can you hold off redoing the room? My brother’s coming out here in a few weeks."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Oh. Yeah. Okay, sure. What’s going on with your brother?"
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Penny,My dad asked if I can get him a job interview at my work.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Huh. Is that a good idea? I mean, you think they’ll consider someone who was in prison for selling drugs?"
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Penny,"Well, I sell pharmaceuticals. That’s just a really hard to spell word for drugs."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Well, I’m sure he’ll appreciate carrying his samples in a briefcase instead of his colon. How long do you think he’ll stay?"
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Penny,"I, I’m not sure. Maybe a few days. Unless he gets the job, then who knows?"
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Leonard,Hmm. Who knows? That’s exciting. I’ll get to wake up every morning and see if he’s still here.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Penny,"You don’t have a problem with this, do you?"
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Of course not. I mean, he’s your brother."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Penny,"Okay. Thank you, you’re the best. Mm."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Leonard,Remember that when the new TV falls off the wall and crushes us both.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon’s office.,Howard,This thing’s pretty cool. It interprets emotions using a wireless signal to analyse subtle changes in breathing and heart rate.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon’s office.,Amy,It’s amazing a machine can do that.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon’s office.,Sheldon,"Yes. Now, when the robots rise up, they’ll know that I’ve been rooting for them the whole time."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon’s office.,Howard,The display is synced to your phone. Give it a try.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon’s office.,Amy,"All right. Now, I’m gonna look at some pictures to prompt an emotional response, and we’ll see if the machine can identify them accurately."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon’s office.,Howard,"Okay, remember, it can only detect happy, sad, angry and excited. Not other things you’re feeling, like, what have I done with my life?"
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon’s office.,Amy,"Okay, I’m looking at the first picture."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon’s office.,Sheldon,You are happy?
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon’s office.,Amy,Yes. I’m looking at puppi
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon’s office.,Sheldon,"Aw. Somebody’s ignoring their tiny needle teeth, but all right."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon’s office.,Howard,Try another one.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon’s office.,Amy,Okay. What does it say I’m feeling?
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon’s office.,Sheldon,Sad.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon’s office.,Amy,Yes. I’m looking at a picture of my grandma.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon’s office.,Sheldon,"Oh, that makes sense, ’cause she’s gone and you miss her."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon’s office.,Amy,Yes.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon’s office.,Sheldon,"And you’re worried that turkey neck is in your future. What, now, see, now it says you’re mad. Make up your mind."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj(on phone),"Okay, Emily. Yeah, sounds great. See you then."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Is that Emily your ex-girlfriend?
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,Yeah. I’m getting all my exes together in order to discuss why they broke up with me and how I can be a better boyfriend.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Oh, God. You went through with that? What is wrong with you?"
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,We are going to find out.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Why would you do that, Raj?"
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"Well, I want information in order to improve myself."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"You’re not gonna get information, you’re just gonna get criticism that hurts your feelings."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"Don’t worry, I’m a grown man. I have a thick skin."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,You’re so stupid.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,Hey.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Penny,"Hey, would you take a look at my brother’s résumé? I’m trying to help him clean it up a little."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Yeah, sure. He really worked with the Drug Enforcement Agency?"
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Penny,"He didn’t know it till he was cuffed, but yeah."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Hey, Leonard, if you’re happy and you know it, no need to clap your hands, because I have an emotion detector."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Leonard,How’s it working out?
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Surprisingly well.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Leonard,"That’s great, I’m happy for you."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"No, wait, uh, hold on. Oh, what, you are. Aren’t you sweet?"
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Amy,What’s that? Are you working on your resume?
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Penny,"No, it’s my brother’s. I’m trying to help him get a job out here."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, ooh! And that makes Leonard angry."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Leonard,"No, it doesn’t."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"What, Leonard, please. I know an angry face when I see it. It’s this red frowny guy on my phone."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Penny,What? Are you really upset about Randall coming?
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Leonard,No.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Yes.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Leonard,I said no.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Sheldon,It’s like you’re twins.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Penny,"Leonard, if you’re mad about this, just tell me."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Leonard,Fine. You invited your drug dealer brother to stay with us for God knows how long and didn’t bother to ask me first.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Penny,He’s my brother. I didn’t think I needed your permission.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, hey. Now she’s angry, too. This thing works like gangbusters."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Leonard,"I’m not saying you have to ask my permission, but you could have talked to me about it before you said it was okay."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Penny,Like you talked to me about your gaming room?
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Leonard,Our gaming room. I was gonna put a scented candle in it.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Sheldon,He’s still mad.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Amy,Stop enjoying their fight.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Sheldon,You first.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Penny,"If you were this upset, why didn’t you say so when I told you?"
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Leonard,Because I didn’t want to sound like a jerk.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Penny,"Well, you sound like one now. I don’t see the big deal if my brother comes and stays for a while."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Leonard,"If you get him a job, he’s gonna live here forever!"
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Penny,He would get his own place.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Leonard,Has he ever had his own place?
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Penny,Yes.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Leonard,Did it have a metal toilet next to the bed?
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Penny,"It still counts. You know, how is this any different from you making me live with Sheldon?"
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Hey, I shared my Honey Nut Cheerios with you."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Penny,You gave me a bill at the end of every month.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Leonard,Stay out of this. You and your stupid machine started this fight.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Sheldon,You are lucky that this feelings machine doesn’t have feelings.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Amy,"Come on, Sheldon, let’s go."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Gladly. Can we storm out?
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Amy,I think it loses its impact if we’re chatting about it.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Fine. I’ll just give them the finger.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Okay, first off, I want to thank you all so much for coming. Howard is here to interpret for Emily, and to take notes."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,"No, he doesn’t think it’s stupid."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Uh, heads up, both of you are named Emily, so we’ll call you red-headed Emily, and you, red-headed Emily, Junior."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,"Hey, you went out with him. I didn’t."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Okay, uh, let’s get things started. Um, why don’t we go around the room, say your name, and why you broke up with me. Want to kick it off?"
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Lucy,"Oh, okay. Um, I’m Lucy, and I broke up with Raj because I have severe social anxiety, and he kept trying to force me into uncomfortable situations."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,Like this one?
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Lucy,Yeah.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"I did do that. I can be insensitive to other people’s boundaries. Howard, would you write that down?"
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,Schmuck. Got it.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Uh, next?"
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Claire,"Okay. Um, I’m Claire. And I guess I broke up with you because you were just really needy. Also, you were incredibly vain, like, all the time you spent shaping your eyebrows."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Okay, new rule, everybody only gets one. Uh, next?"
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Emily,"Ooh, I’m not sure I’m comfortable sharing details about our relationship in front of Howard."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Oh. He’s here to support me, so anything you have to say you can say in front of him."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Emily,"Okay. Well, whenever you and I were in bed…"
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Howard, get out."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,"Not a chance. So, you were telling us how Raj was terrible in bed."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Sheldon, dinner’s ready. I made beef loaf, because I know you’re uncomfortable with the non-specificity of meat loaf. Sheldon? Hey, are you okay?"
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,Not really.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,What’s going on?
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"I wish I never tried that device. And I know I said the same thing after the massage chair, but this time I mean it."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,I’m sorry Leonard and Penny hurt your feelings.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"It’s more than that. It’s me. I always knew I had trouble recognizing other people’s emotions, but that machine just made it so real."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Well, everybody has things that they need help with. Like me, I can’t see without my glasses. And right now you’re just a, a cute, pink smudge wearing a childish green smudge."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"I thought I was getting better at it, but clearly I’m not."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Yes, you are. There have definitely been days when I was sad and you could tell."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Yeah, but that’s shooting fish in a barrel. You’re kind of a sad sack. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said that. I’m just upset."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"No, see, right there, you knew you hurt my feelings. And I’m proud of you, for reasons I’m sure have something to do with my father. And if you don’t like that machine, get rid of it. Because I love you exactly the way you are."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"I feel the same way about you. Now, put your glasses back on. You look weird."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Howard(translating for other Emily),"I thought you were great, but, oh, my God, you were so dominated by your parents."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Emily,"Oh, yeah, that used to drive me nuts. He’s kind of a mama’s boy."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Claire,Kind of?
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Okay, that’s enough. Write down loving son."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Lucy,Can I just say something? Going out with Raj was one of the best things that ever happened to me.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Yes, I’ll take you back."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Lucy,Let me finish. It’s like I needed to go through that experience to know what exactly I don’t want in a man.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Well, that’s hard to hear, but I’ll still take you back."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Emily,"You know, the same thing happened to me. After I broke up with Raj, I met Gary, who’s just amazing."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,"Sorry, is that Gary with one R or two?"
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Would you stop writing? Wait, so, did all of you go on to better relationships after me?"
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Lucy,"Oh, yeah."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Emily,Without question.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Claire,"Little before, actually."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Howard(responding to other Emily),"Oh, wow. Don’t let him get away."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,What did she say?
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,"Uh, basically, she traded you for Bruce Wayne."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Okay, maybe we should just end this."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,"Wait, hang on. I just want to point out to everyone here, this is a man who is going to great lengths to better himself. Even at the risk of being humiliated. And I, for one, think that’s very brave."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Thank you, Howard."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Emily,"Honestly, I’m surprised you two didn’t wind up together."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,"Well, like you gals, I had to suffer through him to find Bernadette."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Sheldon,Yes?
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Leonard,We owe you an apology.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Sheldon,"Oh, it’s fine. You needed a suitcase, I wasn’t home, you borrowed a suitcase."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Leonard,That was six years ago. I’m talking about tonight.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Sheldon,"Oh. Well, I thought we were going in order."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Penny,"Look, we got really angry at each other, and you just got caught in the middle of it."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Leonard,"And, sorry about the suitcase."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Sheldon,"Yeah, well, you should be. Your socks were still in it. I had to throw it away. Anyway, I, uh, trust that you’ve resolved your conflict."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Penny,"Yes, we’re fine."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Leonard,"Mm, Penny’s gonna call her dad and tell him it’s not a good time for Randall to visit."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Penny,"Hopefully, he won’t be too upset."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Leonard,"Oh, you’re his little girl, he can’t stay mad at you."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Penny,"He won’t be mad at me. I mean, you’re the one who doesn’t want my brother to come, so…"
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Leonard,So you’re gonna throw me under the bus?
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Penny,"Oh, I’m gonna throw you so hard, I might actually win a stuffed animal."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Sheldon,"Uh, guys, it sounds like you’re getting angry again."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Leonard,That’s because we are.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Sheldon,Yes. I don’t need an emotion machine. I am one.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,"Thanks, ladies, this was fun. Let’s not wait so long for another bizarre, awkward night."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Well, that was a waste of time. I’m such an idiot."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,Don’t beat yourself up. That’s what I’m here for.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,Maybe I won’t settle down. Maybe I’ll just play the field.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,"Yeah, the field was just here. The field said no."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Dude, come on."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,"Okay, I’ll tell you what. I’ll make you a deal. 30 years from now, if you’re still single and things don’t work out with me and Bernadette, you and I can give it a go."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"I appreciate the offer, but if things don’t work out with you two, I’m swooping in on her like a vulture."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,Too late. Stuart called dibs.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"But theoretically, if you and I were in a gay relationship, how would we tell people? Like, print up announcements?"
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,I don’t know. What difference does it make?
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Well, I want to make sure we get invited to all the parades."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,Those do look fun.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Yeah. Well, if you want to march in a fishnet crop top, you better lay off that dip."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,"If you didn’t want me to eat it, why’d you put it out?"
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"It was for the girls. They broke up with me, I don’t care if they get fat."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,I’m not gonna get fat.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Oh, you want to bet? You never exercise."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,"Fine. Look, I’ll exercise right now. One, two. These are crunches, by the way."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Very mature. Keep eating like that, you’re gonna have a heart attack."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,Okay. How about if I eat like this?
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,You’re such a child.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,"Hey, is that any way to talk to your future husband?"
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Hey, I was being hypothetical, okay? I would never marry you."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,"Please. When you see the ring I pick out, you’re gonna melt."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Yeah, right. Wait, is it rose gold? Actually, don’t tell me, I want to be surprised."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Penny,"So, did you wind up sending that machine back?"
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"I did. You know, I’m not even sure how accurate it was. I took it to the train store, it said everyone was sad."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Bernadette,I finally got Halley to sleep.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Raj,"You know, I just read a study that suggests new mothers are better at sensing emotions for up to two years."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Amy,It’s true. Pregnancy causes physiological changes in the brain that result in increased empathy.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Penny,"So, all we need to do is get Sheldon knocked up."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Leonard,We can’t. He was already fixed when I found him at the shelter.
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Hey, uh, Bernadette, let’s test this theory. What do you think I’m feeling right now?"
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Bernadette,"Let’s see. You’re better than us, a little bit sorry for us, but mostly glad you don’t have to be us."
Series 10,Episode 14,The Emotion Detection Automation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Keep filling this one with babies. She’s good.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Howard,"Okay, I’m zeroing out the electro-osmotic flow rate in the micro-fluidic channel."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Leonard,"Nicely done, Howard."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Howard,"Well, my wife is four-foot-ten and sexually satisfied, so clearly I know my way around tiny things."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Leonard,"Good for you, on the cutting edge of new technology and still making inappropriate comments about the mother of your child."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Howard,Those are just the things I say out loud.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Sheldon,"Gentlemen, we need to stop immediately."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Howard,What’s wrong?
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Sheldon,"I’m looking at the math, and I think we can make the device between eight and ten percent smaller."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Leonard,"That’s great, but the Air Force approved the specs. We’re good to go."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Howard,Yeah. It doesn’t need to be smaller.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Sheldon,"Shame on you. Where would we be if poodle breeders had that attitude? I’ll tell you. We would have the standard and the miniature poodle, but no toy or teacup. Which by the way, is not an officially recognized breed, but that’s just poodle politics."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Leonard,Can we please stop talking about poodles?
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Sheldon,"Fine. Candy bars. Now, do you enjoy a fun size? I know you do."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Howard,"Sheldon, we don’t need to make this smaller, and your work is done. Go home."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Sheldon,I don’t want to go home.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Leonard,"Fine, go for a little walk."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Sheldon,Then what?
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Leonard,Just keep walking.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,,Credits sequence.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Leonard,At least it’s quiet when he takes bathroom breaks.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Howard,I know. That’s why I keep refilling his water when he’s not looking.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Leonard,You’re kidding.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Howard,"I don’t care if we’re in a drought, it’s worth it."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Leonard,"You know, I do have a way to get him out of our hair. I’ve been holding onto this for a few years, but maybe now’s the time."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Howard,"We can just lock the door, you don’t have to kill him."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Leonard,"You can’t kill him, he’ll just respawn at the last save point."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Sheldon,"Oh, that was my sixth trip to the bathroom. As long as that’s not a urinary tract infection, that’s a personal best."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Leonard,"Hey, uh, buddy, I got you a little present."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Sheldon,Really?
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Leonard,"Yeah. Go ahead, open it."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Sheldon,"Congratulations. The bearer of this certificate is entitled to the ultimate train experience at The Nevada Northern Railway. You are at the throttle. You are the engineer. You are running the locomotive. This doesn’t happen very often, but here comes a hug. Oh, dear, I have to tinkle again."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Leonard,Okay. Where were we?
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"For Howie’s occupation, should I include that he was an astronaut?"
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Amy,"Well, he mentioned it in his mother’s eulogy, so why not?"
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Penny,I can’t believe you have to fill out a preschool application for an infant.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"Uh, the one at Caltech has a crazy wait list. I warned you, a lot of people apply when they’re still pregnant."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Well, I didn’t. I also skipped a birthing class to see Zootopia so back off."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,Whoa. Just trying to help.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Sorry. Howie’s back at work and there’s just so much going on.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Amy,Is there anything we can do?
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Sure. Open up a college fund, shop for life insurance, and in the laundry room, there’s a mountain of dirty laundry. Wash it or burn in, your choice. Ugh, be right back."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"No, no. I will take care of it."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Oh, thank you."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"While I’m gone, you can think about how mean you were to me."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Penny,"All right, you know what you need? A night away from all of this. You know, where you can just kind of relax and, I’m just gonna turn this off. Much better. Seriously, let’s plan a night, you know, give you a break. We could go dancing."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,That sounds really nice.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Amy,"Oh. All this week, the Early Music Society of Pasadena is doing a joint concert with the San Gabriel Renaissance Choir."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Penny,"Okay, that’s the one to beat."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Amy,Good luck. People have been saying that for 600 years.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Hey, you’re home early."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"You’ll never believe it. Leonard gave me the most incredible gift, a trip to a historic railway, and I get to operate an actual locomotive."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Wow. He finally used it. What’d you do?
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,No idea. All I know is I’m gonna be working on the railroad all the livelong day.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Well, I’m really happy for you."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, no. It’s not just me. No. The railway is four hours from the nearest airport, and guess who gets to drive me."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,I give up.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,You.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,No. I really give up.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, oh. And guess where we get to sleep? Our choice of a turn-of-the-century railway bunkhouse or a working caboose. Now, the problem with a caboose is there’s no bathroom, but the problem with the bunkhouse is it’s not a caboose. On the first day, I get to drive a steam engine. Oh, and the second day, a diesel engine. Oh, and if I volunteer to do track maintenance and paperwork, they’ll let me stay as long as I want. So you might want to pack enough clothes for the rest of our lives."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Can I pee now?
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, get this. I get to take a test based on a 125-page manual. I get to learn things like hand signals. Ooh. There’s forward, uh, reverse, set the brakes. Are you done yet? You’re missing"
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,,"some great stuff out here. Oh, this is good. There are dozens of railroad crossings you have to blow the whistle for. But that is the figurative you, not the literal you. I’ll be blowing the whistle. Amy, get up. It’s time to go to work."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Leonard,This train thing worked out better than I thought. He’s home studying the engineer’s manual.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Howard,It’s so peaceful without him here. Can I ask you how much that cost?
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Leonard,"Four thousand dollars, worth every penny."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Col Williams,Gentlemen.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Leonard,Colonel Williams. Sir.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Col Williams,Just wanted to see how the guidance system’s coming along.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Howard,Great. We found a cooling solution that allowed us to get the size of the prototype down to the target specs.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Leonard,"As a cooling solution, it’s pretty cool."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Col Williams,Don’t do that. What’s this?
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Leonard,"Oh, nothing. Just some math we don’t need."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Col Williams,This is a different approach. Are you trying to get the guidance system even smaller?
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Leonard,"It’s just a theory. Uh, it’s not even worked out."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Col Williams,Oh. I want this.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Howard,But we’ve already met the agreed upon specs. Going smaller would require weeks’ worth of new computations.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Col Williams,So get the kid with the two shirts to do it.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Leonard,"Sir, uh, if I may, uh, we’ve put a lot of thought and effort into this current prototype. It’s a really elegant solution, and most importantly, it works."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Col Williams,"Yeah, I want this."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Howard,"Okay, but that’s just a theory. It’s not even a complete thought."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Col Williams,"You both make excellent points, and thank you for presenting it so articulately. Make this."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The laboratory.,Howard,The kid with the two shirts screwed us again.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Penny,All right. You guys ready to get crazy?
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Amy,"Well, the bra under here ain’t beige."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Raj,Okay. You ladies have fun tonight.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Stuart,Don’t worry about Halley. Uncle Stuart’s on the job.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Raj,Under the careful supervision of her godfather.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Stuart,"My apologies. I didn’t mean to offend you, Don Corleone."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Raj,"Like I said, you ladies have fun."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Bernadette,"We will. Got my dancing shoes, got my breast pump. Let’s party."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Penny,"You know, if you pump at the bar, I promise we’ll get free drinks."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Bernadette,Call if there’s any problems.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Penny,No. She’s busy. You call Howard.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Raj,Got it.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Bernadette,Call me. Don’t call Howard.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Raj,I would never call Howard.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Stuart,"Okay, instead of arguing all night, let’s just split up the baby chores."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Raj,"Yeah, great. Um, I’ll put food in her top half, you deal with whatever comes out the bottom."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The stairwell.,Howard,I can’t believe we have to ask Sheldon to come back and help us.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Oh, boo-hoo. I spent four grand on a gift that only got rid of him for an afternoon. What is that?"
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The stairwell.,Howard,"I don’t know, but if he yells It’s alive, we run."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Oh, hey. If you knocked, I couldn’t hear you. I’m welding this locomotive engine. And if you didn’t knock, how about some manners?"
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The stairwell.,Howard,How’d you even get that up the stairs?
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"I said to myself, I think I can, I think I can. And then I couldn’t, so I paid two men who promised not to come rob us later."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Okay, look, Sheldon, the Colonel wants us to make the guidance system smaller, and we can’t do it without you."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Interesting. Well, so I was right."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The stairwell.,Howard,Open a window. It’s about to get smug in here.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Well, I would love to help you, but since I discovered the satisfaction of working with my hands on a train engine, I don’t think I can go back to theory. I’m an engineer now. And, hey, just to be clear, a train engineer. Not that goofy kind you are."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Sheldon, you can still go on the trip in a few weeks. Just help us out."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,Sorry. I need to work on this engine so when I get to the train yard I won’t look foolish.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The stairwell.,Howard,He’s worried about looking foolish. That’s a heapin’ helping of irony right there.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Come on, you know you’re not leaving physics. Why are you doing this?"
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Leonard, in the world of theoretical physics, you never finish. So much is unprovable. But when I was studying that railway guide, it was so tangible and so satisfying that something just clicked. Then it clacked. Then it clicked, then it clacked, click-clack clickety-clack, and here we are. Whoo-whoo."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car.,Amy,"Hey, did you hear anything back from the Caltech preschool?"
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car.,Bernadette,"Not yet, but we’re gonna apply to a bunch of others just to keep our options open."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car.,Penny,"Okay, stop that. No more preschool talk. Tonight is about having fun."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car.,Amy,Nothing says fun like being scolded.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car.,Bernadette(phone rings),"Oh, it’s Raj. Everything okay?"
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car.,Raj,Don’t worry. Everything’s fine.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car.,Stuart,"Hang up, we don’t need help."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car.,Raj,I don’t need your help deciding when we need help!
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car.,Bernadette,"Raj, what’s going on?"
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car.,Raj,"Yes, so, I was just warming up some milk for Halley, and I thought it smelled a little funky, so I checked the date that you wrote on the bottle, and it says Flerbsday."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car.,Stuart,It says Tuesday.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car.,Raj,How is that a T?
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car.,Bernadette,"I’m sure it’s fine, but if you’re worried, there’s extra milk in the freezer."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car.,Raj,"Okay, yes, I will err on the side of caution and defrost a fresh batch."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car.,Stuart,You’re wasting perfectly good milk.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car.,Raj,"Fine, you drink it."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car.,Stuart,It’s just milk.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car.,Bernadette,"Stuart, don’t you drink my milk."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car.,Penny,"Okay, give. Can you guys handle this or not?"
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car.,Raj,"Oh, of course we can. Uh, you girls have a good time. She said I was in charge."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car.,Stuart,Hmm. So we just throw this away?
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car.,Raj,What else are you gonna do with it? Put it in your coffee?
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car.,Stuart,"Well, I don’t take it black."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The apartment.,Leonard,Okay. This is everything he had on the board. I’m sure we can figure the rest out.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The apartment.,Howard,All right. Hmm. Feel free to jump in. Hmm is all I got.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, we can get this. Is there any chance it’s upside-down?"
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The apartment.,Howard,Maybe we can find another theoretical physicist to help us.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The apartment.,Leonard,"It’s classified. If we tell anyone, we’d get in trouble."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The apartment.,Howard,"Hey, I came up with that and hmm. You haven’t pitched anything."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The apartment.,Leonard,Just keep thinking. I got it.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The apartment.,Howard,You really figured it out?
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The apartment.,Leonard,"No, but when we show this nonsense to Sheldon, it will make him crazy, and he’ll have to fix it."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The apartment.,Howard,"Oh, you’re a genius."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Yeah, I know. That’s not even a math symbol. That’s just Charlie Brown’s hair."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Penny,"Sorry, guys. This club was so great, how could they turn it into a bookstore? I thought we got rid of all those."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Amy,"Renaissance Choir’s looking pretty good right now, huh?"
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Bernadette(on phone),Hello?
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Raj,"Nothing to worry about. She’s just been crying for a little while, and I was wondering if you had any tricks to get her to sleep."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Stuart,She was sleeping just fine till you took a selfie with her.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Raj,She was blowing a spit bubble. It was adorable.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Bernadette,You guys got this? Do you need me to come home?
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Stuart,Wait. She’s settling down.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Raj,"Oh, okay, false alarm. Little parenting tip, sleeping babies hate flash photography."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Penny,Is everything okay?
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Bernadette,Yeah. I may have just left my infant daughter with Patrick and SpongeBob.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Amy,"Hey, there’s another dance club nearby. I mean, I don’t know how you feel about Latin music, but according to their horas of operación, they’re open."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Penny,Maybe we should just call it a night.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Amy,You sure? They’re open till dos.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Bernadette,"Yeah, we’re all dressed up. Why go home?"
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Penny,I’m just not really in the mood anymore.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Bernadette,What’s going on with you?
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Penny,I don’t know. This is all starting to feel like a sad attempt to recapture our youth.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Bernadette,I’m not sad. I just wanted to get drunk and not wear sweatpants.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Amy,"I’m not sad. I mean, hello."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Penny,"Okay, maybe I’m the one who’s sad."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Amy,What are you sad about?
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Penny,Maybe the fact that you went and had a baby.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Bernadette,You’re upset I had a baby?
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Penny,"No, of course not. I just, I didn’t think it would make me have all these feelings."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Amy,What feelings?
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Penny,"Pressure. I mean, she’s looking at preschools, she has a minivan, she has a 401K. Before she talked about it, I just thought that was a race."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Bernadette,"You think that stuff is fun? Being a parent is terrifying. I’m constantly worried, I’m always tired, and in a few minutes I’m gonna milk myself in a bookstore parking lot."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Penny,"I get that, okay? It’s just, Leonard and I have been married for two years, and we’re no further along than when we were dating."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Amy,Come on. You’ve got so much to feel good about. You’ve got a great job now.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Penny,"Yeah, I guess I am making decent money."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Amy,You make more than I do.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Bernadette,"You may not have a house yet, but your apartment’s great."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Amy,It’s bigger than mine.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Bernadette,"And Leonard loves you so much, he married you twice."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Amy,"I’m not even engaged once. I don’t even know if Sheldon thinks about marriage. I’m not getting any younger. Honestly, I kind of thought by now, we might have had some sort of…"
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Bernadette,Careful. The sound of crying can make me lactate.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Amy,I’m sorry. I can’t help it.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Penny,"Oh, that’s gonna make me cry."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Bernadette,And there they go.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Penny’s car,Penny,Ew.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Leonard,"Well, Sheldon, turns out we didn’t need you after all."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Howard,That’s right. We figured it out all by ourselves. Wasn’t even that hard.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Leonard,No.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, good for you guys. Look, I have a grease smudge on my hand, and I’m okay with it."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Leonard,Aren’t you gonna look at the board to see how right we are?
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"No, thanks. I’m busy trying to fix this fuel pump."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Howard,It’s a manifold.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh. Well, I guess it’s fixed."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Leonard,Just look at the board.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,That’s wrong.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, no, what should we have done differently?"
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, first of all, you can’t use relativistic and non-relativistic vectors in the same equation."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Howard,Told ya. Can you fix it for us?
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Okay, but this is the last time. Nice try, blockheads."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Leonard,"Come on, Sheldon. You can’t turn your back on physics, and besides, you have no idea what you’re doing with this stuff."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Howard,"But if you really want to learn the mechanical side, I can teach you anything you want to know."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Leonard,"And instead of standing around watching, you can help us build your smaller guidance system."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Howard,"And with all these new skills, you’d be able to fix any model train. You’d be the king of the train store."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,Excuse me. I have a girlfriend. I’m already king of the train store.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Leonard,"So, what do you say?"
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, what choice do I have? You need me. I’m like the crankshaft of this team."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Howard,That’s a turbo.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, whatever it is, it looks heavy. I’m gonna need you two to get it downstairs before Amy comes home."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The cab of a steam locomotive.,Sheldon,I apologize that it’s so warm in here.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The cab of a steam locomotive.,Amy,It is warm in here.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The cab of a steam locomotive.,Sheldon,I’ve worked up a bit of a sweat.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The cab of a steam locomotive.,Amy,"Me, too."
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The cab of a steam locomotive.,Sheldon,May I borrow your water?
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The cab of a steam locomotive.,Sheldon(voice),The light’s green.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The cab of a steam locomotive.,Amy(now in her car),Sorry.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The cab of a steam locomotive.,Sheldon,GPS says we’ll be at the railway in three hours.
Series 10,Episode 15,The Locomotion Reverberation,The cab of a steam locomotive.,Amy,I can get us there in two.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Howard,"Go. Come on, Raj."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Leonard,You can do this.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Sheldon,There’s no way.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Penny,What is happening?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Leonard,"This is an Euler’s Disk. It’s a physics toy that demonstrates angular momentum, potential energy, and kinetic energy."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Penny,"Aw, look at you watching sports."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Howard,We’re betting to see if Koothrappali can hold his breath longer than the disk can spin.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Its weight and smoothness, along with the slight concavity of the mirror, means it can spin for a long time."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Leonard,"But Raj is from India, which means he’s no slouch at holding his breath."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Penny,"Okay, I want in. Ten bucks says I’ll lose interest before that thing stops spinning."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Amy,"Hey, Sheldon, I found a great restaurant for date night."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Kind of busy right now.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Amy,"Oh, an Euler’s Disk, fun."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Howard,"Yeah, we’re seeing if Raj can hold his breath longer than it."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Amy,Oh. Immature.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Leonard,How ya doing?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Sheldon,He’s not gonna make it.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Howard,"Yes, he is."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"You know, deep-sea divers holding their breath for several minutes have shown elevated markers of a protein that can signal brain damage."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Penny,"Yeah, see, what’s happening here signals brain damage. My God, how long does this thing spin for?"
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Howard,"Ha, you’re interested. You’re out ten bucks."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Sheldon,It’s slowing down.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Dig deep, like when we bet you couldn’t fit into Howard’s pants."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Sheldon,He’s not gonna make it.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Yes, he is."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Howard,"Come on, Raj, it’s like your favourite movie, you’re just Waiting to Exhale. Yeah, I knew you could do it."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Raj,"And j, and just so you know, my favourite movie is Princess Bride."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,,Credits sequence.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Raj’s office.,Dr Koothrapalli(on skype),"Hello, Rajesh. How are things by you?"
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Raj’s office.,Raj,"Good, good. Uh, listen, I just wanted to let you know when you get my credit card bill, it might be a little high this month."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Raj’s office.,Dr Koothrapalli,"Well, you’re a grown man with a steady job. Why wouldn’t you spend all your father’s money?"
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Raj’s office.,Raj,"Oh, Daddy, you’re so rich and funny."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Raj’s office.,Dr Koothrapalli,Yeah. So what else is going on with your life?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Raj’s office.,Raj,"Uh, well, I was dating a woman at the university, but we broke up."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Raj’s office.,Dr Koothrapalli,I’m sorry to hear that.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Raj’s office.,Raj,"I know you are. That’s why you just bought me a new iPad. And before you start, I am not interested in you arranging a marriage for me."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Raj’s office.,Dr Koothrapalli,"Oh, I gave up on that a long time ago."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Raj’s office.,Raj,You did?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Raj’s office.,Dr Koothrapalli,It’s too much work. You’re an adult who can’t get by without an allowance from his parents. Women don’t want that.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Raj’s office.,Raj,"What are you saying, that you’re giving up on me? What kind of father gives up on his son?"
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Raj’s office.,Dr Koothrapalli,"I have six children, five of whom are married and self-sufficient. I don’t think I’m the problem."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Raj’s office.,Raj,I can’t believe what I’m hearing. This is deeply hurtful.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Raj’s office.,Dr Koothrapalli,You’re also too sensitive. Women don’t want that either.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,A restaurant.,Amy,The food here’s supposed to be great. Don’t fill up on chips.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,A restaurant.,Sheldon,"Oh, I won’t. I only eat equilateral triangles. Isosceles, isosceles, oh, scalene. You didn’t see that."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,A restaurant.,Amy,"Oh, look. It’s Bert, at the bar. We should go say hi."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,A restaurant.,Sheldon,Why?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,A restaurant.,Amy,Because that’s what you do when you see someone you know in a public place.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,A restaurant.,Sheldon,I have multiple restraining orders that say otherwise.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,A restaurant.,Amy,"Sheldon, there’s a difference between greeting a friend and following a celebrity into a bathroom."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,A restaurant.,Sheldon,"If the judge couldn’t explain it to me, I don’t see how you will."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,A restaurant.,Amy,"Hi, Bert."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,A restaurant.,Sheldon,Hello.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,A restaurant.,Bert,"Oh, hey, guys. What brings you here?"
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,A restaurant.,Amy,"Oh, we’re having date night."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,A restaurant.,Bert,"Nice. I’m meeting someone, too."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,A restaurant.,Amy,"Oh, really. Anybody we know?"
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,A restaurant.,Bert,I doubt it. I met her on G-Harmony. That’s a Web site for geologists to find love.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,A restaurant.,Amy,That’s a real thing?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,A restaurant.,Bert,Yeah. Their slogan is we’re all about dating and not the carbon-14 kind.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,A restaurant.,Sheldon,"Well, have a lovely evening."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,A restaurant.,Bert,"Thanks. You, too."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,A restaurant.,Sheldon,"If you think that’s more fun than talking to Zachary Quinto through a stall door, you’re crazy."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Penny,"You know, we could’ve come to you guys. You didn’t have to bring the baby here."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Bernadette,"Oh, it’s okay. It’s good to get out of the house."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Howard,And the car ride puts her to sleep.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Aw, that used to work with Sheldon."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Penny,"Yeah, until someone left him in the drugstore parking lot and he freaked out."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Leonard,Who forgot to crack the window?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Raj,Hello.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Leonard,Hey.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Penny,"Oh, someone’s been shopping at Gucci."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Raj,"Yeah, I saw something for Halley and I couldn’t resist."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Bernadette,That’s so sweet of you.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Raj,"Yeah, it’s a crushed velvet baby cape."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Howard,"Oh, no, now we have two."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Penny,That must’ve been expensive.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Raj,"Yeah, it was. But it’s my father’s money and I’m mad at him."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Leonard,What’s going on with your dad?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Penny,"And if you really want to hurt him, I look great in Chanel."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Raj,It turns out he doesn’t care if I’m married or if I’m single. He’s basically given up on me.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Bernadette,"Oh, I’m sure that’s not true."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Raj,It is. He stopped trying to find Indian girls for me to marry.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Leonard,But all you did was complain when he did that.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Penny,"Wait, Leonard, he’s hurting. Let him feel how he feels."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Raj,"Thank you, Penny."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Penny,"Yeah. Shoes, I’m a seven-and-a-half, boots, I’m an eight."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The restaurant.,Sheldon,"MSN Search, AltaVista, and Ask Jeeves. You?"
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The restaurant.,Amy,"Sorry, I don’t have a list of defunct search engines that I miss."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The restaurant.,Bert,"Hey. Looks like I got stood up, so I’m gonna head out."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The restaurant.,Amy,"Oh, no. Are you sure you don’t want to give her a few more minutes?"
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The restaurant.,Bert,"Nah, G-Harmony recommends after two hours, it’s time to cut bait."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The restaurant.,Amy,I’m so sorry.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The restaurant.,Sheldon,"Bert, I insist that you join us."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The restaurant.,Bert,You really wouldn’t mind?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The restaurant.,Sheldon,Not at all. Amy?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The restaurant.,Amy,Fine with me.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The restaurant.,Bert,Thanks. I’ll go grab a chair.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The restaurant.,Amy,"Sheldon, that was so sweet of you."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The restaurant.,Sheldon,"Well, I could deduce by his facial expression and body language that he was sad."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The restaurant.,Amy,So the part where he got stood up didn’t clue you in?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The restaurant.,Sheldon,You want me to look at him and listen to him?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Raj,My father thinks the reason I can’t make a relationship work is because I’m spoiled.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Leonard,"I’m sorry, is he waiting for someone to disagree?"
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Raj,Just because he helps me out doesn’t automatically mean that I’m spoiled.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Penny,"All right, how much exactly does he pay for?"
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Raj,"Okay, I’ll tell you, but please don’t judge me. He pays for my car, my rent, and my credit cards."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Leonard,"I’m trying, but I’m judging."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Howard,Maybe your dad’s right.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Penny,"Yeah, women do like a man that can support himself."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Raj,But Bernadette makes more money than Howard. She basically supports him.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Bernadette,"Yeah, maybe your dad’s right."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The restaurant.,Bert,"Good question. Let’s see. Infoseek, WebCrawler, oh, HotBot."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The restaurant.,Amy,"Okay, literally any other topic."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The restaurant.,Bert,All right. How did you guys meet?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The restaurant.,Sheldon,"Actually, we met online."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The restaurant.,Amy,Our-our first date was at a coffee shop.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The restaurant.,Sheldon,"Although, unlike your date, she actually showed up. Oh, he looks sad again."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The restaurant.,Bert,"Well, I really envy your relationship. Other than you two only having sex once a year, you’re the perfect couple."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The restaurant.,Amy,You-you know about that?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The restaurant.,Bert,"Uh, yeah, everyone at the university does."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The restaurant.,Amy,Were you aware of this?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The restaurant.,Sheldon,"No. No, I only told Leonard, Howard, Raj, Kripke, uh, Professor Wu, Professor Klein, and a lunch lady in the cafeteria. How everyone else found out is a mystery to me."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,Why aren’t you talking to me?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The stairwell.,Amy,Because I’m mad at you.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Oh. Well, now I’m sorry I asked."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The stairwell.,Amy,"Sheldon, it’s humiliating. Thanks to you, my colleagues are gossiping about our sex life."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,What is there to gossip about? We barely have one.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The stairwell.,Amy,That’s why they’re doing it.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Is it safe to assume you’re not speaking to me again? If you’re not answering because you’re not speaking to me, perhaps we could come up with a signal. That works."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Howard,You don’t need your dad’s money. You can get by on your salary.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Yeah. Well, we work at the same place as you, and we’ve always been fine."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Raj,"Oh, please. Look in the mirror. You both look ten years older than I do."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Penny,"All right, hang on. We can figure this out. Let’s just go over your expenses. How much is your rent?"
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Raj,I don’t want to say.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Bernadette,Is it really that high?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Raj,I don’t want to say because I don’t know how much it is.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Penny,You don’t how much your rent is?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Raj,My father pays for it. Do you know how much your rent is?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Penny,Yeah.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Raj,"Well, then double it, because my building’s a lot nicer than this dump."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Leonard,Do you know how much your car costs?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Raj,Not really.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Howard,"Well, how much do you spend on food?"
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Raj,The housekeeper does the shopping.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Bernadette,"Oh, my God, you really are spoiled."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Raj,I’m spoiled? Your baby has a cape that costs $300.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,I’m going to bed.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, wait. This is our first fight as a couple who live together."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,So?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"I’m not sure of the protocol. Television teaches us that the man’s supposed to sleep on the couch, but of the two of us, you’re clearly more sofa-sized."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,I’m not sleeping on the couch because you don’t know what’s private and what’s not.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,This isn’t fair. You’ve discussed aspects of our physical relationship with Penny.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"That’s different. She’s a close friend, not the lady in the cafeteria who cuts the crust off your sandwiches."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"That lady has a name. I don’t know what it is, but one time I accidentally called her mom."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Leonard,Sounds like you’re gonna need a cheaper place to live.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Bernadette,"When you moved here, you didn’t have a lot of money. How’d you get by?"
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Penny,"Well, sometimes you can get free food and Wi-Fi from the neighbours. Just know you might have to marry one of ’em."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Hey, you guys let Stuart live with you. Why not Raj, too?"
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Howard,"What, what are you doing? I, I, I schlepped the baby over, I brought imported beer. Why don’t you like me?"
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Raj,I thought we were best friends?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Howard,"We are, that’s why I’m sad my best friend’s gonna be homeless."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Bernadette,"I’m sorry, Raj. We really just don’t have the space."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Leonard,What if he lives in your garage?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Bernadette,What if you stop helping?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Raj,"Guys, I’m not living in a garage."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Howard,Wait. Why are we talking about our place when Sheldon’s old room is sitting there perfectly empty?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Bernadette,That’s a great idea.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Penny,"Raj, if you need a place to stay, of course you are welcome here."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Raj,"Thank you, but if I’m gonna just take advantage of my friends, I might as well keep on relying on my father."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Penny,"Okay, only if you’re sure. Whew."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The apartment.,Leonard,Yeah.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock)Amy?(Knock, knock, knock)Amy?(Knock, knock, knock)Amy?"

Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"Not exactly the welcome wagon, but I’ll take it."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,What is this?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"I’m mapping basic topics of conversation and with whom they can be discussed. I call these circles zones of privacy. Don’t Google that unless you want to see pictures of people’s genitals. This circle contains only me and you. It represents subjects we only share with each other, details of physical intimacy, bathroom habits. Although, as I’m saying it, I may need to add Dr. Fink in here."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,Are you really worried about revealing secrets to Stephen Hawking?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"No, I was just excited to list him as a friend."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,"Well, I do appreciate you working on this."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"I’m sorry you were embarrassed. And now I understand that some things are just between you and me, and in the event of redness and swelling, Dr. Fink."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,What’s that little dot in the middle?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,That’s reserved for thoughts I don’t share with anyone.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,Interesting. You really have secrets you don’t tell me?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,Of course.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,Can I hear one?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"No, they’re private."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,Why? Are they naughty?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,A little.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,Please?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,Fine. Two years ago I got my driver’s license.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,What? Why didn’t you say anything?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,I like being chauffeured around. It makes me feel important.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,"So when I got up at 4am. to drive you across the desert to an antique train museum, I didn’t have to?"
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"No, you didn’t. But keep in mind, I felt extremely important."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Raj’s office.,Dr Koothrapalli(on skype),What?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Raj’s office.,Raj,"Hello, Father. We need to talk."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Raj’s office.,Dr Koothrapalli,All right.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Raj’s office.,Raj,"I have come to an important decision. I will not be accepting your money any more. I’m a man, and I can take care of myself."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Raj’s office.,Dr Koothrapalli,That’s wonderful.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Raj’s office.,Raj,"Yes, that is wonderful. You will no longer be able to accuse me of being spoiled."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Raj’s office.,Dr Koothrapalli,I am so proud of you.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Raj’s office.,Raj,"Dad, I’m trying to tell you off, and you’re ruining it with your delight and relief."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Raj’s office.,Dr Koothrapalli,"Sorry. Oh, no, my grown son is going to stop spending all my money. Where did I fail as a father?"
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,Raj’s office.,Raj,"Yeah, that’s right. Keep asking yourself that. But I still love you very much, so don’t cut me out of the will."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"Oh, you brought your own lunch. Good for you."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The cafeteria.,Raj,"Yeah, I’m making a bunch of changes. This morning, I fired my dog walker."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The cafeteria.,Howard,Oh. How’s the dog gonna go to the bathroom?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The cafeteria.,Raj,"Uh, I gave her an Imodium. That’s tomorrow’s problem."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Excuse me. May I have your attention, please? I have recently been made aware that my personal relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler has become water cooler gossip. And I just want to say, shame on all of you. We’re scientists. Our minds should be focused on the advancement of human knowledge, not the intimate details of other people’s lives."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The cafeteria.,Bert,He’s right. And I’m sorry for the part I played in this.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Thank you, Bert. You’re a good man. That woman who stood you up and humiliated you last night really missed out."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The cafeteria.,Bert,That doesn’t paint me in the best light.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Oh. Oh, I’m sorry. Correction, that woman not only had vigorous coitus with Bert, she also tipped him a dollar for a job well done. – That better?"
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The cafeteria.,Bert,Not really.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"All right, well, to sum up, focus on science, keep your nose out of other people’s business, and, uh, whoa, for a good time, call Bert."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The cafeteria.,Leonard,What brought that on?
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Well, last night Amy was angry with me because I’d been foolishly telling people about certain personal matters."
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The cafeteria.,Howard,That’s understandable.
Series 10,Episode 16,The Allowance Evaporation,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Oh, I know that now. At first, I thought she was cranky because of her horrific menstrual cramps, but it turns out, no, she was genuinely mortified."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,,Following a “previously on” sequence,
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Sheldon,Uh-huh. Interesting. Okay.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Raj,How bad is it?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Let me put it this way, do you own a barrel and suspenders?"
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Raj,Are you serious?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Sheldon,I’m not wearing this visor to play women’s golf.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Penny,Hi.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,Hey.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Penny,"Oh, let me guess. You guys are drafting your fantasy accounting firms."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,We’re helping Raj figure out his finances.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Penny,"Well, he has a job. How bad can it be?"
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, his rent and car lease are exceedingly high. You couple that with his penchant for dining out and shopping."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Penny,"Wait, wait, not shopping for clothes, right? Because look."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Sheldon,He also has a remarkable amount of credit card debt.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Howard,I thought your dad paid your cards.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Raj,I have a card for emergencies that I pay for myself.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Sheldon,What emergency happened at the L.A. Zoo?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Raj,"That’s a penguin I sponsor. They’re losing their homes to global warming, and my car gets, like, seven miles a gallon, so I felt bad."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,What is Pink Cheeks?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Raj,It’s intimate waxing. Quit looking at that.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,Maybe you should find someone to help you get your finances under control.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Raj,Like a business manager?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Sheldon,"No, absolutely not. You can’t afford to hire someone who’ll forbid you from spending your money on foolish expenses. That is a foolish expense, and I forbid it."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Howard,What if there’s someone who just likes controlling other people and stealing joy from their lives?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Sheldon,He sounds like a sociopath.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,"We don’t know, his mother never had him tested."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Sheldon,You’re talking about me. Very funny. Although I would enjoy drawing up a budget and forcing Raj to adhere to it without an ounce of compassion.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Penny,"Wait, wait, who’s gonna break it to the penguin?"
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Raj,"Okay, Sheldon. Yeah, I’m putting you in charge of my finances. I will not spend another penny that you don’t authorize."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Very well. Hey, Comic-Con tickets go on sale this Friday. You can’t buy one."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Howard,"Oh, better luck next time, Pink Cheeks."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,,Credits sequence.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,You’re actually going to Comic-Con?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Penny,"Well, Leonard wants me to do more stuff like that with him, so I thought maybe this year I’d tag along."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Well, that’s sweet. I bet you’ll have fun."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Penny,"So, do you want to come?"
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"No, thanks. I already live in a place all the nerds come to."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Penny,Please? I went to your boring thing last month.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,My aunt’s funeral?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Penny,"Come on, even you checked your e-mail during the eulogy."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Well, I’m not going, but I do think it’s nice you want to."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Penny,"It’s not that I want to go, I just think it’ll make Leonard happy. And if I have to watch him squeeze into an Ewok costume, so be it."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Look at you, going to Comic-Con, talking about Ewoks. I really have become the cool one around here."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Howard,You actually think Penny will have fun at Comic-Con?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Leonard,"No. Which will make me miserable, which is usually Sheldon’s job."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Sheldon,She’s gonna hate waiting in line for the panels.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Howard,And hate all the crowds at the panels.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Sheldon,She’s gonna hate the panels.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Leonard,She’s gonna hate how often we say the word panels.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Howard,Why don’t you just tell her not to come?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Leonard,"Well, she’s so excited, I can’t do that to her."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Howard,What if you make it sound so bad she won’t want to go?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Leonard,That I would do to her.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Raj,"I can’t believe Penny’s gonna get to go, and I’m not."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Sheldon,"You can always watch the panels online. Oh, boy, we do say that a lot."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Stuart,Panels. Just wanted to be included.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,,"Raj; Come on, Sheldon, it’s Comic-Con. Just let me have the money for this, and I won’t ask for anything else."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Sheldon,"You put me in charge of your finances. If you wanted someone weak and spineless you could walk all over, you should have asked Leonard."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Leonard,See? Miserable.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Raj,"Okay, you’re right, I got myself into this, but I’ve never missed a Comic-Con with you guys."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Sheldon,"Your father may have spoiled you, but I won’t. If you want a ticket to Comic-Con, I suggest you figure out a way to earn the money yourself."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Howard,"Yeah, you’re a grown man who’s highly educated. You could charge people money to punch you."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Raj,"Go ahead, make jokes. I don’t know why you think you’re going to Comic-Con, you just had a baby."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Howard,So?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Raj,"Well, so? So you think Bernadette’s just gonna let you jet down to San Diego for five days and leave her alone?"
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Leonard,"Hang, hang on. So I have to bring Penny, you can’t afford it, Howard’s gonna get in trouble, and this guy gets to have a great time."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Sheldon,I’m gonna go as Dumbledore.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Mm-mm, how’s my favourite girl?"
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Okay.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,What you doing?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Making lasagna.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Oh, she’s sexy, she can cook. I’m such a lucky guy."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"You want something stupid, or you did something stupid?"
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"No. I just walked in here, saw how beautiful you are and had to tell you."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Oh, dear God, you’re cheating on me with Raj."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Ha ha ha, never gets old. Okay, there is something I want, but it’s not a big deal."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,What is it?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Well, Comic-Con tickets go on sale this Friday, and I was hoping I could go with the guys. But before you say anything, I’ll make up for being gone by doing everything around here, I mean everything. I’m even gonna answer for you. Yes, Howard, you can go."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,It’s so hard to say no to you.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,Thank you.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,So I’ll say maybe.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,What? Why?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"You said tickets don’t go on sale till Friday, right?"
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,Yeah.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"You said you were gonna do all this stuff for me, right?"
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,Yeah.

Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,Yeah.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"If you don’t know how to make lasagna, Google does."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,"Okay, so this is the main Comic-Con floor. It’s where all the vendors and exhibits are."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Penny,"Wow, that is a lot of people jammed in there."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,"I know. Sometimes Howard wears a striped shirt so we can play Where’s Wolowitz? Okay, now, This is us camping out in line for the Avengers panel."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Penny,"Oh, you really sleep on the sidewalk, huh?"
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,"Yeah. It can get chilly, but Raj figured out that if you pee in a bottle and put it in your sleeping bag, it helps keep you warm. Here’s the hotel room we all share."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Penny,"Well, you and I would get our own room, right?"
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,"Every hotel is booked. But, yeah, see this space here between Sheldon’s feet and my head? That’s where you go."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Penny,"Well, it’s no different than when Sheldon used to climb in bed with us during a thunderstorm."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,"Don’t worry, we won’t be doing much sleeping anyway. It’s like an all-night party. There’s trivia contests and Dungeons & Dragons. As we like to say, it’s off the chain mail."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Leonard,"I even said off the chain mail, and she still wants to go."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Sheldon,That’s probably my fault. She may have heard about my cool Dumbledore costume.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Stuart,"Okay, I can give you 20 bucks for the whole box."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Raj,But you charged me hundreds for this stuff.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Stuart,I know. And I did it with a straight face.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Raj,But I need to earn enough money so I can go to Comic-Con.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Stuart,"Well, all right. I’ll give you 25 bucks. That’s my best offer."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Raj,I have no choice.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Stuart,"You know, if you want to make extra money, I could throw some work your way."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Raj,Really? I’ll do anything.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The comic book store.,Stuart,"Great, you’re hired. First thing you can do is put price tags on these. Start the little ones at fifty."

Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Penny’s car.,Amy,Comic-Con’s five days.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Penny’s car.,Penny,Are you kidding me?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Penny’s car.,Amy,Why don’t you just tell him you don’t want to go?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Penny’s car.,Penny,"I can’t, it’ll break his heart. You know, he’s always making an effort to do things with me he doesn’t enjoy, like going outside."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Penny’s car.,Amy,He is an indoor cat.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Penny’s car.,Penny,"You know, maybe it won’t be that bad. Leonard says it’s really mainstream now. Comic books aren’t just for sad nerds any more. I mean, it is still a key part of their demographic."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house. Raj rings the doorbell.,Bernadette(off),"Howie, can you get that?"
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house. Raj rings the doorbell.,Howard(off),Kind of busy.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house. Raj rings the doorbell.,Bernadette(off),Busy like I’ll be with the baby if you go to San Diego?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house. Raj rings the doorbell.,Howard,Hey.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house. Raj rings the doorbell.,Raj,What’s with the gloves?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house. Raj rings the doorbell.,Howard,They complete my ensemble. What do you want?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house. Raj rings the doorbell.,Raj,I’m looking to make extra money and was wondering if you had any chores I could do.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house. Raj rings the doorbell.,Howard,"Hang on. Bernie, can I outsource my chores to an Indian guy?"
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house. Raj rings the doorbell.,Bernadette,No.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house. Raj rings the doorbell.,Howard,I tried.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,"Hey, I was thinking, if you want to do a couples costume, we could paint ourselves green and be Hulk and She-Hulk. Or we could paint ourselves blue and go as Nightcrawler and Mystique."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Penny,Is there any scenario where we’re not in full body paint?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,"Yeah, if you want us to look like losers."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Penny,"Hey, um, are you sure the guys are okay with me coming?"
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,"Yeah, of course, why?"
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Penny,"This is just something you usually do together, and if I’m screwing it up, I don’t have to go."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, why? Do you not want to go?"
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Penny,Why? Do you not want me to go?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Leonard,"No, I want you to go."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,The apartment.,Penny,"Okay, good, ’cause that’s what I want, too."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Leonard,Now we’re going as Hulk and She-Hulk. I don’t want to take my shirt off at Comic-Con.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"If I may speak for Comic-Con, we don’t want that either."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Leonard,Is that nice?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"No, but it’s honest, and it sounds like you could use a little more honesty in your relationship."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Leonard,"Uh, it’s more complicated than that."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"I’m always honest with Amy. The other day she said she was self-conscious about the beauty mark on her shoulder, and I said, you know, you can call that a beauty mark all you want. When there’s hair growing out of it, that’s a mole."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Leonard,Do you think she’s as honest with you?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"I should hope so. When she called me an insensitive jerk, I’d like to think she meant it."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,There’s got to be other ways you can make a quick buck.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"Yeah, you’d think. Ooh, maybe I could sell my blood and sperm."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,I really should wear a bell around my neck so you guys can hear me coming.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"Here, let me help you."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Thank you.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"Oh, Double Stuffed Oreos, I remember when I could afford you."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,There she goes.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,"Stay, I’ll get her."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,I appreciate it.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Raj,That’s fine. She and I can cry together.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,He’s such a sweetie.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"I know, I wish there was some way we could help him."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"If he could find a girl with a job, all his problems would be over."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Yeah, that’s working out great for me."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Penny says they’re ready to go.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,Very well. Prepare for a long night of deceit.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Sheldon, women can wear make up, it’s not lying."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"I was talking about Leonard. And if make up is so truthful, why is it called concealer?"
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Wait, wait, wait, what’s Leonard lying about?"
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,He doesn’t really want Penny to go to Comic-Con. He’s just doing it to make her happy.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Really? Because she doesn’t actually want to go. She’s just doing it to make him happy.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"So they’re both trying to make each other happy, and the end result is they make each other sad? That’s hilarious. I can’t wait to tell them."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"No, you’re not gonna tell them anything. You’re gonna stay out of it."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,Why?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Because it’s between them.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, if you haven’t noticed, I’ve been between them for the last ten years."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Penny,Hey.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Hi.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,Hello.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Penny,"Hey, babe, you want to drive?"
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Leonard,"Sure, or you can."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Penny,"No, it’s fine, I know you don’t like the way I drive."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Leonard,I don’t have a problem with your driving.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,Are you listening to this? They deceive each other about everything.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Shh.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Penny,"Just so you know, that guy in the parking lot hit me."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Leonard,"He wasn’t in a car, but okay."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Penny,Just say you want to drive.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Leonard,I honestly don’t.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Penny,"Amy, do us a favour, please drive."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Sure, happy to."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Leonard,"If you want to drive, just drive. I don’t see why this has to be so complicated."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Penny,"It’s not complicated. Amy’s driving, that’s it."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Leonard,That’s not it because you’re clearly upset.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Penny,You’re the one who seems upset.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Leonard,Why would I be upset?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Because you don’t want her to go to Comic-Con.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,This is an interesting way to stay out of it.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Penny,"Wait, you don’t want me to go?"
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Leonard,"Well, I just don’t think you’re gonna have a good time."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Yeah, well, get this, neither does Penny, that’s why she doesn’t want to go. You set ’em up, I knock ’em down, good job."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Leonard,Why would you say you wanted to go if you didn’t?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Penny,I just thought it would make you happy.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Leonard,"O-o-o-okay, hold on, so if you don’t want to go and I don’t need to bring you, is everything good?"
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Penny,"Hold on, I’m trying to decide if I’m mad at you. No, I’m happy I don’t have to go."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Leonard,"All right, problem solved."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Penny,Okay.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Not entirely, the fight over who’s going to drive is still…"
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Oh, my God, stop talking."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Amy,The place looks great. Did you guys get a maid?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Bernadette,Kinda.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Howard,"Dinner’s almost ready. If you like meatloaf, I’m sure you’ll like its cousin, bowl of meat."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Penny,"Hey, if you’re still looking to make money, I will pay you to burn that jacket."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Raj,"Thank you, but it doesn’t look like I’m going to Comic-Con this year."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Sheldon,"Well, with as much debt as you have, probably not next year either."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Bernadette,Howie?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Howard,Sure. This is for you.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Raj,What’s this?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Bernadette,It’s back pay for all the babysitting and taking care of Halley you’ve done.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Howard,There’s more than enough in there to cover Comic-Con.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Stuart,"Um, I also take care of Halley."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Bernadette,And you live here for free.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Stuart,"I do, ma’am, thank you, ma’am."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Raj,"This is so generous of you, I, um, I don’t know what to say."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Leonard,Now you can come with us.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Penny,"Yeah, there’s room in the bed by Sheldon’s feet."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Raj,"As much as I appreciate this, I can’t accept it, okay? Halley’s my goddaughter, I don’t take care of her for money."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Stuart,I would.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Bernadette,Keep it. Consider it a gift.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Sheldon,Hold on. Is it back pay or is it a gift?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Bernadette,What’s the difference?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Sheldon,"When the IRS questions us in separate rooms, we need to have our stories straight."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Raj,It doesn’t matter. I’m not keeping this. I’m trying to pay my own way and be responsible. Taking handouts won’t help that.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Amy,So you’re not going to Comic-Con?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Raj,"I’ve been plenty of times. If I miss one, it’s fine. I’m a big boy."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Sheldon,"I’m a big boy, and if I missed one, I’d throw a big-boy tantrum."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Leonard,"You know what? I’ve gone 12 times. Maybe I’ll sit out this year, too."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Penny,Really?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Leonard,Yeah. Maybe you and I can do something fun that weekend.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Penny,"Ooh, how about white-water rafting?"
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Leonard,"Oh, how about we compromise and go on the Small World ride at Disneyland?"
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Howard,"You know what, I’m not gonna go either. I’m a father now. I’d rather spend time with my family."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Bernadette,You just don’t want to go alone with Sheldon.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Howard,I’m gonna go check on dinner.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Amy,Sounds like everyone’s staying home. What do you say?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Sheldon,"Nuts to that, I’m going to Comic-Con."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Amy,By yourself?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Sheldon,Not necessarily. I have four months to find some new friends.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Stuart,I’ll go with you.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Howard and Bernadette’s house.,Sheldon,"That’s very kind of you, Stuart. Check back in with me in July."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,There’s my pretty girlfriend.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,I’m not going with you to Comic-Con.
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,What? Can’t a man just be happy to see his woman and pat her on her second most erogenous ball-and-socket joint?
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"He can, but it’s still not changing my mind."
Series 10,Episode 17,The Comic-Con Conundrum,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, maybe what’s in my pants will change your mind. It’s a list of this year’s panelists. It’s long, isn’t it?"
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Leonard,"Aw, man, did you see this post from Raj?"
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Penny,What? Is it another video of him and his dog Lady-and-the-Tramping some spaghetti?
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Leonard,"No. He can’t afford his apartment, and he’s asking if anyone knows of a cheap place to live. I want to say India, but it seems mean."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,What’s so funny?
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,"Raj is looking for a cheap place to live, and I wrote India."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,"Don’t post that, be supportive."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,"Maybe you should be supportive of my hilarious jokes. Fine, what should we do?"
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,We’re smart. I’m sure we can think of something.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,You want to let him live here?
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,"Oh, we’re smarter than that."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"I know our apartment’s small, but I think we can make room."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,"No, Sheldon. We are not getting a life-size Spider-Man statue."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Leonard,"We do have Sheldon’s old room. If he really needs a place to stay, I guess we should offer it to him."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Penny,You’re a good friend.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Leonard,Am I still a good friend if I wait and hope that Howard offers him a place to live first?
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Penny,You’re an even better husband.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,"I know if the roles were reversed, he would do it for me."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,Where would he stay? We already have Stuart.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,"Well, we can make some space in the garage. Maybe put a cot out there, get him a space heater, maybe a hot plate."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,That sounds awful.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,"Let’s hope he thinks so, too."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,"For the last time, no Hulk, no Batman, no life-size statues."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,Wow. I’m starting to think you didn’t mean it when you said you wanted to spruce up the place.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,,Credits sequence.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Raj’s apartment.,Raj(answering phone),Hello.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,"Hey, uh, so we’ve been talking, and if you need a place to stay, we’d be happy to fix up the garage for you."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"That would be amazing. I was literally just looking at my moving boxes, trying to pick one to live in."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,"I know it’s not ideal, but you’d have plenty of space for your furniture, and there’s this cool button that makes an entire wall go up and down."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,I cannot thank you enough.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,"It is our pleasure.(beep, beep, beep)Hey, can you hold on one sec? Hello?"
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Raj’s apartment.,Leonard,"Hey, buddy, you still looking for a place to live?"
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Uh, yeah. Why do you ask?"
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Raj’s apartment.,Leonard,"You know, we have the extra bedroom, and if you need it, it’s yours."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Oh, my God, that’s so generous."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Raj’s apartment.,Leonard,It’s the least we can do.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"I really appreciate it. Uh, can you hold on one second? Hey, so, Howard, what’s the bathroom situation gonna be?"
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,"Well, there’s a sink out there, that takes care of half your problems."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"But I can use the downstairs bathroom, right?"
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,"Yeah. We barely use it, so it’ll be like it’s yours."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Cool, cool, yeah, yeah, hold on one second."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,What?
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Hey, what’s it like sharing a bathroom with Penny? Is there hair everywhere? Does she use your loofah?"
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Raj’s apartment.,Leonard,I don’t have a loofah.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Okay, well, if I move in, you can’t use mine. Hold on a second. Hey, Howard, uh, how’s the Wi-Fi in the garage?"
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,I don’t know. Why are you asking all these questions?
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Well, to be honest, Leonard’s on the other line, and he offered me their spare bedroom."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,Great. Go live there.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,But you made the garage sound so fun.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Raj’s apartment.,Howard,"I just didn’t want you to feel bad about it. Unless Leonard’s apartment also has a raccoon that chews its way in on cold nights, go there."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"One second. Okay, I think we’re close. How do you feel about a mini-fridge in my room?"
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Raj’s apartment.,Penny,"Hey, pal, you want to live here or not?"
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Raj’s apartment.,Raj,"Oh, uh, hi, Penny. Yes, please."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Leonard,Hey.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Amy,Hi.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Sheldon,"Hi, uh, Penny, this circular is addressed to occupant, but with our apartment switch, it’s unclear whether it’s yours or mine."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Penny,What’s it for?
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Sheldon,Roofing.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Penny,"Yeah, it’s yours."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Sheldon,"Okay, thanks. Just throw it out. Speaking of occupants, I’m given to understand Raj will be moving into my old room."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Leonard,"Yeah, for a little while."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Sheldon,What about his dog?
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Penny,"She’ll be in her crate, it’s not a big deal."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Sheldon,I suppose that’s acceptable.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Amy,"Well, Sheldon’s getting a little better with dogs. He even took a picture with Pluto at Disneyland."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Sheldon,"If real dogs gave me buttons, I’d like them, too. Well, I think it’s very nice that you’re helping out our friend."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Leonard,And I think it’s nice that you’re taking whatever medication Amy’s clearly giving you.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Sheldon,And what is that supposed to mean?
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Penny,"Well, it’s like that science thing. For every action, you have a gigantic and annoying reaction."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Leonard,Just when I thought you couldn’t get any hotter.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Penny,Mm-hmm.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Sheldon,"If you’re implying that I’d have some problem with him moving into my room, you’re wrong. Raj is in a difficult financial situation, and I’m glad that he’s making changes to improve it."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Leonard,Do not adjust the dosage. You nailed it.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Amy,Don’t listen to them. What’s weird is that Penny almost got a science fact right.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Sheldon,"I mean, it’s unfair; people just assume I’m going to be upset by Raj moving into my old room."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Amy,"But you are, aren’t you?"
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Sheldon,"Oh, I’m outraged."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Amy,Talk to me. Tell me what’s going on.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Sheldon,"Well, that’s been my room since before I met Leonard, and now someone else is going to be living in it. And that someone else is not me. And you know how I feel about people who aren’t me."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Amy,"There are a lot of memories wrapped up in that room. For me, too. The first time you told me you loved me was in that room."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Sheldon,Wrong. We were standing outside my room in the hallway.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Amy,And there is the love of which I speak.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Sheldon,"I realize it’s irrational, but with Raj moving in there, I’m feeling a bit replaced."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Amy,"Well, this isn’t an easy time for him. He’s losing his apartment, he’s in debt, he’s probably humiliated."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The lobby.,Sheldon,"Yes, probably. But until we know for sure, how can I feel better?"
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Raj,Can I get anyone anything at all?
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Penny,"Raj, you don’t have to serve us."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Raj,It’s the least I can do for helping me carry my stuff up.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Howard,It was really no problem.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Bernadette,"Not for you, box of towels."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Raj,"Anyway, thanks again."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Howard,"Hey, look at that. You’ve got a Raj, we’ve got a Stuart. Maybe we should take them both to the park and let them run around together."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Leonard,I don’t know. Yours looks like he has worms.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,You ready to go?
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,All set.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,What’s that?
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,A housewarming gift for Raj.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Well, a bunch of fake snakes better not spring out of it, ’cause that was a lousy anniversary present."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"It’s nothing like that. I just, I thought about Raj’s situation, and I had a change of heart. You know, and regarding your gift, you said surprise me, and, boy, did I. Hello."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Leonard,Hey.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Penny,Hi.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Leonard,Perfect timing. Food’s ready.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Uh, wait, before we eat, I have a little welcome to the building gift for Raj."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Penny,"Wait, is anything gonna jump out of that."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,No. I already asked.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Raj,"Thank you, Sheldon. It’s a blank notebook."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, I had some of my best ideas in that room, and I’m sure you will, too."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Howard,He also never had sex in that room. That’s something else to look forward to.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Raj,This means a lot.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, I know this is a difficult time for you. You’re losing your apartment, you’re in debt, and you just, you must be humiliated."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Sheldon.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, good grief. She is such a stickler for citing sources. Those were Amy’s words."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Sheldon.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"I know, I know, good grief was originally said by Charlie Brown, geez."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Raj,"You’re right, I am humiliated. Thanks for pointing it out. You’re such a jerk."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,Can you believe this guy?
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Everyone,Yes.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,I thought that was gonna break the other way.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Come on, Sheldon. Maybe we should just eat at our place."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,Fine. You took my room. You turned my friends against me. I hope you’re happy.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Raj,What do I have to be happy about? My life’s a wreck.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,How come he can say it and I can’t?
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Just keep walking.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Beverley(on skype),"Hello, Sheldon. What a pleasant surprise. How are you?"
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Honestly, I’ve been better. Do you have time? Leonard says you’re very busy these days."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Beverley,"Oh, I just say that because he prattles. What’s going on?"
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, our friend Raj moved into my old room, and it’s brought up a lot of negative feelings for me."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Beverley,"Mm. Well, what do you think the loss of your room represents?"
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Beverley, you know I hold you in high esteem. Can we skip the part where you pretend not to know the answer, and get to the part where you tell me the answer?"
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Beverley,"Very well, but, uh, if you don’t mind, I’d still like to pause for effect. Now, you’ve recently moved in with Dr. Fowler, yes?"
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,I have.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Beverley,"Clearly, your old room represents an escape hatch, and without it, you’re forced to confront the terrifying reality of being trapped in a relationship with Amy forever."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,I hadn’t thought about that.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,And don’t start thinking about it now.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Beverley,"Hello, Amy. Your defensiveness may indicate similar insecurities about your relationship with Sheldon."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,That’s not true.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Beverley,She said defensively.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,This isn’t about me and Sheldon. This is about Rajesh moving in with Leonard and Penny.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Beverley,Interesting. They’ve found a need to take yet another room mate. Seems they’re avoiding some harsh realities themselves.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"I had no idea all our relationships were such a disaster. Boy, you’re good."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Beverley,"That is the word on the street, dear."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Raj,"Maybe moving in was a bad idea. I haven’t been here one day, I’m already causing problems."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Penny,You didn’t do anything. It’s Sheldon.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Leonard,"You didn’t do anything, it’s Sheldon. That’d make a nice needlepoint pillow."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Penny,"So, relax. We’re happy to have you."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Raj,"Thank you, but how do I know you’re not saying that just to be nice?"
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Penny,Do you actually pay for that haircut?
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Raj,That’ll do it.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Hey, Raj, I owe you an apology. Look, could you please put your dog on a leash?"
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Raj,"Sheldon, she’s fine."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, then at least hold her still so I can pretend she’s stuffed. Raj, I let my emotions get the best of me, and I unfairly took it out on you."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Raj,Thank you. I appreciate that.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Sheldon,"No, I can’t take all the credit. I spoke with Leonard’s mother, and she made me feel better."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Leonard,"I don’t know who you talked to, but that wasn’t my mother."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Beverly pointed out that I’m experiencing insecurities in my relationship with Amy, in the same way that Leonard and Penny are in their relationship."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Penny,What are you talking about? We’re fine.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Yes, you’re fine as long as you have a buffer living with you to distract from your marital problems. It used to be me. Now it’s Raj and his attack Tribble. Anyway, I’m sorry for everything. Oh, and FYI, if you cry while they’re fighting, they’ll take you to McDonald’s."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Beverley(on skype),"Hello, Leonard."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Leonard,Why are you saying we have marital problems? We don’t have marital problems.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Beverley,I see. You must be yelling at me out of wedded bliss.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Leonard,"Look, just because we took our friend in does not mean that Penny and I are afraid to be alone."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Penny,"Yeah, this is a special circumstance."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Beverley,"Sheldon mentioned you tried to get your brother to live with you, as well."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Penny,"Yeah, well, a circumstance can happen twice and still be special."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Beverley,Do you agree with that?
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Leonard,"Well, now that you point it out…"
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Penny,Are you kidding me?
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Leonard,We do seem to keep finding room mates.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Penny,Now you’re taking her side?
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Beverley,"Dear, I would never come between you and Leonard. That’s for your parade of room mates to do."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Raj,"Howard? Howard? It’s me, it’s just me."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,What are you doing here?
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Raj,"Well, I texted you, but you didn’t respond. Leonard and Penny were arguing."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Stuart,Not on my watch.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,"It’s fine. It’s just Raj. You can hit him with the bat, but it’s fine."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Stuart,"And if my heart stops, just let me go."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Raj,"I’m sorry, guys. Sheldon was upset, Leonard and Penny were fighting, I just wanted to go some place where I wasn’t causing problems."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,I’ll say it again. India.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Raj,Can I just stay in the garage?
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Bernadette,Don’t do that. We’ll make up the couch for you and figure out something in the morning.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Raj,Thank you.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Stuart,"Come on, I’ll get you some sheets. Then I’ll see if I can beat my high score on the blood pressure machine."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.,Howard,Never should’ve had all these kids so close together.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,You okay?
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,I can’t sleep.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,What’s wrong?
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,Beverley believes I unconsciously consider my old room an escape hatch.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,Is that bothering you?
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,Yes. I don’t care for unconscious thoughts. My brain and I are best friends. It should tell me everything.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,"I mean, how it relates to our relationship, not the bromance between you and your brain."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,What if she’s correct? Doesn’t that say something troubling about us?
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,I don’t know. I just think you’re the kind of person who likes a contingency plan.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,That is true. Did you know I figured out in which order I would eat all my friends in the event of an apocalypse?
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,You need to stop hanging out with your brain so much. It’s not a good influence.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Stuart,"If you’re looking for spare change, I already cleaned it out."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Raj,"Well, didn’t think this is where my life would be."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Stuart,"Me, either. I’m in a bedroom and you’re on a couch. I’m actually winning."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Raj,"You know, we’re both down on our luck. Maybe you and I should try to get a place together."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Stuart,"Okay, listen to me. There is no reason to leave here. This is great. Everyone’s nice. It’s comfortable. If all goes according to plan, this is my retirement home."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Raj,Wouldn’t you feel better about yourself if you were more independent?
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Stuart,Better than I feel in their steam shower? I don’t think so.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"Penny would be the entree. Then Leonard’s basically a cheese course. And because I love you, you’re dessert."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,"I want to say aw, but I’m gonna say ew."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Raj,"No, you see, I’m doing this so I can stop being spoiled and, you know, grow as a person."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Stuart,Good for you. This sandwich has six dollars worth of ham in it.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Raj,Don’t you even feel a little bad sponging off your friends?
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Stuart,"Hey, look, I went to art college, I tried to make it as a graphic artist, a comic book artist, and you know what I got for my efforts? A visible rib cage. I’m not kidding. You could see my heart beating."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Raj,"Well, no offence, but I didn’t go to art school. I have a PhD in astrophysics."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Stuart,"Oh, great, it’ll be easier for you to look up at the stars without a roof over your head."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Penny,Morning.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Leonard,Did you know Raj moved out last night?
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Penny,What? Why?
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Leonard,"Leonard and Penny, I’m sorry for all the trouble I’ve caused. I went to stay at Howard’s. PS Cinnamon’s with me, but if you feel like messing with Sheldon, tell him she’s loose in the building."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Penny,I feel terrible.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Leonard,Should we go bring him back?
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Penny,"Well, you’re the one worried having someone live with us is a sign of problems."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, that was just because my mother got in my head. It’s like being possessed, but instead of Satan it’s, actually, it’s the same thing."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Penny,"All right, so we’ll ask him to come back."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Leonard,"Well, great."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Penny,Don’t you want to get dressed first?
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Leonard,"Just one second. Help, Cinnamon’s loose in the building."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,The apartment.,Sheldon(off),"Amy, quick, lock the door."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Penny,We’re so sorry if we made you feel uncomfortable. We really weren’t fighting about you.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Raj,I just never want to be a burden on my friends.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Stuart,"Me, either. Don’t want to be a burden. Hey, is that the baby? I’ll go check."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Leonard,"You are not a burden, and we want you to come back and stay with us."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Raj,"But I also upset Sheldon, and he’s not gonna want to come over if I’m there."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Penny,More reasons for you to stay.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Stuart,Halley’s fine.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Bernadette,"You know she’s at my parents’ house, right?"
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Stuart,And she’s having the time of her life.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Howard,"If you ever want to change things up, you’re always welcome here."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Bernadette,"Just not in our bedroom, you dumbass."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Raj,"I appreciate it, but I think staying with Leonard and Penny makes more sense for everyone."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Penny,Then it’s settled.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Raj,"And just so you know, it’s only temporary. I’m not gonna get too comfortable."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Bernadette,Good. Nobody needs a mooch living in their house forever.
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Howard and Bernadette’s living room.,Stuart,"Hey, that’s no way to talk about your baby."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"You know what? I’m proud of us. Yeah, with Penny and Leonard taking in Raj, and Stuart living with Howard and Bernadette, we’re the only couple of our social group who doesn’t need to fill the holes in their relationship with a third party."
Series 10,Episode 18,The Escape Hatch Identification,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Yup, we’re killin’ it."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Raj,"You know, downward-facing dog comes from the Sanskrit phrase adho mukha shvanasana."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Penny,"Oh, that’s beautiful. What does it mean?"
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Raj,Downward-facing dog.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Penny,"Yeah, I guess they don’t have Sanskrit for butts up and heads down."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Raj,"Hey, we wrote the Kama Sutra. If it involves butts, there’s a word for it."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Leonard,I thought we were getting breakfast before work.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Penny,"Oh, right, sorry."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Raj,It’s my fault. I asked Penny to do yoga with me.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Penny,"If you want, I can get ready in five minutes."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Leonard,It’s cute that you think that. Don’t worry about it.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Raj,"Hey, can I ask you a favour? Would you mind taking Cinnamon for a walk?"
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Sure. You’re living here for free, I guess I owe you."

Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Amy’s car.,Sheldon,"Oh, the project is classified. I can’t tell you. Oh, I suppose I could redact the classified parts. All right, um, I came up with an elegant solution to the(honks horn)I used the(honks horn)And then I(honks horn)And that did it.(Car passes honking horn)Wow, I wonder what they’re redacting."

Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Amy’s car.,Sheldon,So you’re attempting to pinpoint where consciousness resides in the brain.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Amy’s car.,Amy,"Yes, I’m trying to figure out to the nanometer and the attosecond, precisely where and when an event of awareness takes place."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Amy’s car.,Sheldon,"Well, what do you know? Here I was, waiting to be bored with biology, and instead you tickle my intellectual fancy. Which, unlike my body, is an okay place to tickle."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Amy’s car.,Amy,"You know, when I was six, I wanted to marry the gorilla from Good Night, Gorilla. Maybe I was onto something."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Gentlemen, the most interesting thing just happened with this spoon."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The cafeteria.,Howard,"Unless it was singing Be Our Guest, I doubt it."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Yeah, I picked it up without thinking about it. Which raises a neuroscientific question, when did I decide to pick it up?"
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The cafeteria.,Raj,"The bigger question is, what are you gonna eat with that spoon? You didn’t get any food."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The cafeteria.,Leonard,He does raise an interesting point.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Amy is studying the time lag between intent and awareness, and I realized that applies to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. Now, I recognize there will be a time lag between me saying that and you Googling what it means, so I’ll wait."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"I understand it, Sheldon."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The cafeteria.,Raj,"Yeah, me, too."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The cafeteria.,Howard,"I’m sorry, I spaced. Are we still talking about the spoon?"
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The cafeteria.,Raj,It’s nice to see you taking an interest in Amy’s work.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Well, don’t get me wrong. Neurobiology’s nothing more than the science of gray squishy stuff. But, you know, when it connects to physics, gas up the Ford, Martha, we’re going for a drive."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Raj,So did you confront Jennifer?
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Penny,"No, I was going to, but she called in sick. And guess who else called in sick."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Raj,Paul.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Penny,Paul.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Leonard,Who’s Paul?
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Penny,"Oh, you met him at the office Christmas party. He’s married to Nancy."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, sure. Wait, Nancy?"
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Penny,"I bet Jennifer gets a promotion out of this, which is so unfair because I work twice as hard as she does."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Raj,"Don’t worry, Jerry won’t be fooled by that type of behaviour."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Leonard,Jerry?
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Raj,"It didn’t work for Randy, it didn’t work for Tina, it sure as hell isn’t gonna work for Jennifer."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Penny,"Well, I hope not. I just hate when people play those kinds of games."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Leonard,Tina?
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Raj,"With your sales record, you have nothing to worry about."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Penny,Mm.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Leonard,I went to your office Christmas party?
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"You know, I like harp lessons, but I’m thinking of switching to elevator repair lessons. What are you working on?"
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"I was thinking about your experiment on the neuroscience of decision making, and I realized, if we connect it to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics, we have a chance to disprove the role of consciousness in the Copenhagen Interpretation."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Wait, are you saying if we combine my experiment with your calculations, we can determine the precise moment in time when the wave function collapses?"
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,It could be the most inspired combination since I mixed red Icee into my blue Icee. It was like drinking two sevenths of the rainbow.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Sheldon, this is really interesting."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Yeah, and this one won’t stain my teeth purple."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"You know, we’ve never collaborated professionally before. Are you worried it might affect our relationship?"
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,That is a valid point. Perhaps we should establish some ground rules.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Well, that would make me feel better."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"All right, let’s start right now. Uh, rule number one, no using sexuality to get your way."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,That’s a ridiculous rule.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,Is it?
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Penny,"Okay, how is that?"
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Raj,I can actually feel the toxins being pulled out of my skin.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Penny,"Well, this is a moisturizing mask."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Raj,"Oh, well, then I can actually feel the moisture going into my skin."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Penny,"Hey, I hope you don’t mind, I used a little of your eye cream last night."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Raj,I thought someone looked brighter and tighter.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Leonard,I’d still like to know who Jerry is.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Penny,"Don’t worry about it. Hey, after this, how about we all go out and do something together?"
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Leonard,That would be great. Thank you.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Raj,You want to go shopping?
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Penny,"Ooh, yes. Fun."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Or we could do something we’ll all enjoy, like play a board game."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,,Montage of shopping scenes.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,I believe I’ve made some progress on our ground rules.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Oh, good. What are they?"
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Okay, uh, number one, in matters of physics, I have the final say. In matters of neuroscience, you have the final say. Unless I disagree. Oh, here. Number two, when we publish,"
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,,"my name goes first. Oh, subsequently, if we win any awards, I speak first. I don’t want to be talking when the orchestra plays us off."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Can I see that?
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, of course. I’ll get that back. Like all my underwear, that notebook says Property of Sheldon Cooper."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Sheldon, if we’re gonna have ground rules, I’ll tell you the first ground rule. I make the ground rules."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"I’d write that down, but I can’t now, can I?"
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Howard and Bernadette’s minivan.,Leonard,"I mean, they didn’t say anything, but I just kind of felt like I was being a weird third wheel."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Howard and Bernadette’s minivan.,Howard,"Huh, so you can tell what that feels like. Interesting."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Howard and Bernadette’s minivan.,Leonard,"Anyway, I figured I can hang out with my friends and have fun, too."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Howard and Bernadette’s minivan.,Bernadette,"Well, if your idea of fun is riding in a minivan to Target for diapers, things are about to get nuts."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Howard and Bernadette’s minivan.,Leonard,"Oh, it’s just nice to be with people who are happy to have me around. Isn’t that right, Halley?"
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Howard and Bernadette’s minivan.,Halley,(cries)
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Howard and Bernadette’s minivan.,Howard,"Well, at least someone had the courage to say it."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Sheldon,"Thank you, you are a good citizen. Told you. Go ahead, throw my underwear out the window. Same thing’s gonna happen."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Amy,Terrific. Do you want to hear our new set of ground rules?
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Sheldon,Fire away.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Amy,"Number one, we’re on the same team, we’re not in competition."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Sheldon,"That’s smart, because Sheldon 1, Amy 0."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Amy,"Number two, disagreements can happen politely. There’s no need to call an idea stupid."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Sheldon,"Aw, someone drew a penis in it."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Amy,Are you listening?
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, go ahead."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Amy,"Number three, to avoid getting frustrated, we take built-in breaks and reward our successes with a small treat."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Sheldon,"Ooh, that sounds fun. Now, we’re talking about real treats, right? Not Bible verses like my mother used to give me."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Amy,"Whatever you want. So, shall we get to work?"
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Sheldon,"Biology and physics coming together, this is like the peanut butter cup of the mind. Oh, I know what I want my treat to be."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,,Montage of Sheldon and Amy working together.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Amy,Wow. Look at that.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Sheldon,"Yes, this is remarkable."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Amy,"So we’re agreed, it’s complete garbage."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s door.,Sheldon,"By the way, your name can go first."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Inside a store.,Leonard,"I mean, I’m glad they’re getting along, but it’s starting to make me uncomfortable."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Inside a store.,Bernadette,"Well, are you worried he’s like another man in her life?"
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Inside a store.,Leonard,"A little, until I saw them in matching tops."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Inside a store.,Howard,Nice. 174 diapers. That ought to get us to Wednesday.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Inside a store.,Bernadette,"Well, have you talked to them about it?"
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Inside a store.,Leonard,"Well, what am I supposed to say, stop having fun without me?"
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Inside a store.,Howard,This one says that every time I go out. See? I listen to you.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Inside a store.,Bernadette,"Look, Raj just gets along with women."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Inside a store.,Leonard,"I know, but he was my friend first. It’s like she’s stealing him and they’re just having the best time doing all their dumb girly stuff together."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Inside a store.,Howard,You sure you don’t fit in? You sound like a catty bitch to me.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,I don’t know where we went wrong.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Yeah, the math is so inelegant. I’m not even sure it makes sense."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Well, don’t give up. Maybe we can fix it."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,Can you stop breathing so loud? I can hear your nose whistling.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"I can hear your face talking, so we’re even."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"All right, either blow your nose or teach it to play Camptown Races."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Fine. Fine. You want me to blow my nose? Here, I’ll blow it. Better?"
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"No, I can still hear it. Oh, wait, that’s me. Never mind, it’s fine."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"You know, you’re exhausting. I knew working together was a bad idea."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Hold on. I see what’s wrong here. We did the propagation only to the occipital lobe, not to the prefrontal cortex."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,That would mean that this delayed parameter should be increased 250 milliseconds.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, that is much better. Yeah, boy, if good ideas came out of your brain the way mucus comes out of your nose, we’d be in good shape."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Raj,"Now, take a sip, swirl it around your mouth, and try to notice the flavours, the tannins, the textures. Well?"
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Penny,I probably should have spit out my gum first.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Raj,"Yeah. You know, the last couple of weeks have been pretty rough, but, uh, staying here with you guys has really helped take my mind off of it."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Penny,"Mm. Well, we’ve loved having you around. Right, sweetie? Leonard?"
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Raj,When did he leave?
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Penny,"Yeah, that’s rude."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Howard and Bernadette’s minivan.,Leonard,"You know, it’s nice to spend time with people who don’t talk about work like it’s some kind of soap opera."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Howard and Bernadette’s minivan.,Bernadette,Jennifer still trying to sleep her way to the top?
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Howard and Bernadette’s minivan.,Leonard,Yeah.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Howard and Bernadette’s minivan.,Howard,You should be happy someone wants to do the stuff with Penny you don’t want to.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Howard and Bernadette’s minivan.,Bernadette,"Yeah, I wish I had that with Howard."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Howard and Bernadette’s minivan.,Howard,Wait. What? What do I make you do?
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Howard and Bernadette’s minivan.,Bernadette,"Let’s see, the magic store, the Doctor Who convention, the National Belt Buckle Collector’s meet and greet."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Howard and Bernadette’s minivan.,Howard,"It said right there on the invitation, buckle up for fun. It’s not my fault you didn’t listen."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Howard and Bernadette’s minivan.,Leonard,I’m sure I’m overreacting.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Howard and Bernadette’s minivan.,Bernadette,"You’re entitled to feel how you feel. If you don’t like it, you should just talk to her."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Howard and Bernadette’s minivan.,Leonard,I don’t want to sound like a jealous baby.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Howard and Bernadette’s minivan.,Bernadette,"Oh, then maybe you shouldn’t talk to her."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"I had a feeling you were using the wrong computational model, but I didn’t say anything ’cause you’re so sensitive."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Just because I am easily bothered by light, heat, sound, smell and the way birds look at me does not mean I’m sensitive."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Hey, I wonder what kind of success we’d have if we defined measurement as the first moment that an action potential is seen by the visual cortex."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,That is a daring and insightful solution.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,We’re finally making progress. I wish we could do it without fighting.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,What if the fighting is the reason we’re making progress?
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,I suppose it’s conceivable that the hormones associated with our fight-or-flight response could be sharpening our cognitive processes.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, if that’s the case, then your grandparents mumble and have bad posture."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"How dare you speak that way about my Grammy and hey, wait a second. Wait. Delta T could equal alpha sub-zero."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"It seems we have a choice to make. Abandon all ground rules in the name of science, or give up collaborating for the sake of our relationship."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,There’s only one clear choice.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,Science it is.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"No, you bonehead."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Name calling, that is perfect. Now, when I get to this equation here, really let me have it. You know? If it helps, I’m not the sharpest dresser."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Anyway, I know it’s silly, but since Raj moved in, I’ve been feeling a little left out."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Penny,"Well, sweetie, that’s crazy."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Raj,"No, no, Penny, don’t dismiss his feelings."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Leonard,Thank you. I just feel…
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Raj,"Hang on, I’m not saying that his feelings aren’t crazy. I just don’t want him to think that this isn’t a safe place."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Well, to be truthful…"
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Penny,"Well, why wouldn’t this be a safe place? I mean, he’s surrounded by his wife and one of his best friends."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Raj,I don’t want to speak for Leonard.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Leonard,Thank you. I…
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Raj,"But when you’re insecure, no amount of external validation can ever make you feel safe."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Penny,"Yeah, you’re right. You know, you’re really sensitive about this kind of stuff."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Raj,I’m a good listener.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Penny,Yeah.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Hey, Olsen twins…"
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Penny,What?
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Well, I mean, I’m sitting right here. You’re talking about my feelings and somehow leaving me out of the conversation."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Raj,I’m sorry. What did you want to say?
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,The apartment.,Leonard,"I don’t know, you pretty much covered it."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,Can you read them back?
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Revised ground rule number one, we are on the same team, but it is a competition."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Excellent. Excellent. And on a related point, you’re going down, punk."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Revised ground rule number two, there are definitely stupid questions, and those who ask them can be told so right to their stupid face."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,I love that one.
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Thanks, babe. Number three, fair topics for insult include educational pedigree, scientific field, intellectual prowess, and mamas."
Series 10,Episode 19,The Collaboration Fluctuation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Yeah, that list is strong. Like your mother’s urge to be promiscuous with sailors."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Penny,"Hey, Leonard, if you’re not busy tomorrow, I have to do a little reception after work."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, I would, but we need to make a push on the air force project."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Penny,"Oh, are you sure? We’re celebrating our new ADD drug, and it’ll probably be over in, like, six minutes."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Amy,Did you say you guys are working on the guidance system tomorrow?
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Yeah, why?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Amy,"Well, Sheldon said that he was gonna work with me on our quantum perception project."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Leonard,We’ve had this planned for a week.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Amy,"Well, he reconfirmed with me this morning."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Raj,"Guys, before this gets ugly, remember, the winner gets Sheldon."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Penny,"Hey, Raj, do you want to go with me tomorrow?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Raj,"Are you asking because you want me there or out of pity? Actually, never mind, don’t answer. I’d love to."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Hello.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Amy,Why did you tell Leonard you’re working on the gyroscope tomorrow?
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Because I am.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Amy,But you said you were working with me.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Penny,Uh-oh. Someone’s got two dates to the nerd prom.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"I have a plan to work on both projects simultaneously. And for your information, the summer conference on algebraic topology at Caltech is nerd prom."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Leonard,"I’m sorry, what is this plan you have?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, I’m not needed at both places at the same time. And I can also free up extra hours with simple tricks, such as using a minimal amount of words to convey my point."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Leonard,When does that start?
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Soon. See, I could’ve said in the near future, but I didn’t say in the near future, because in the near future is three more words than soon. In, one, the, two, near, three, future, four. See, in the near future is four, soon is just one, four is more than one, saving time already."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Raj,"Genius. I was gonna say, why does anyone think Sheldon’s a genius? But I didn’t."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The guys laboratory.,Sheldon,"Gentlemen, I’ve got Amy up and running. Shall we get to work?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The guys laboratory.,Howard,"Uh, before we do, what are you wearing, oh, friend who we pretend is normal?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The guys laboratory.,Sheldon,"These are hydration backpacks. For efficiency, whenever I’m thirsty I have access to water. When I’m hungry, I have lentil soup."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The guys laboratory.,Leonard,It’s getting harder to pretend.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The guys laboratory.,Howard,"Anyway, Sheldon, we’re at a decision point to run the xenon stream through the cryo-cooler or through the vacuum filter."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The guys laboratory.,Sheldon,Run down the pros and cons of each for me.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The guys laboratory.,Howard,"Well, if we run the xenon stream through the cryo-cooler, it’ll be cooled immediately before it reacts with the conduction."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The guys laboratory.,Sheldon,"Oh, sorry, uh, carrot chunk."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The guys laboratory.,Howard,You can just feel the time being saved.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Amy’s laboratory,Sheldon,"Ah, I’m back, you got me for eight minutes."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Amy’s laboratory,Amy,"Sheldon, this is silly. You can’t expect us to do quality work with you popping in and out like this."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Amy’s laboratory,Sheldon,"The coefficient isn’t lambda, it’s lambda sub one. And over here, you should consider the possibility that the brain itself is in two different quantum states. And lastly, do you have any little soup crackers?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The guys laboratory,Howard,The rate of spinning for the central axis centrifuge has to be four revolutions per second.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The guys laboratory,Leonard,"It can’t be four revolutions, it’s got to be seven."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The guys laboratory,Howard,"Seven? Look at the board, it’s four."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The guys laboratory,Leonard,"Oh, my God, it’s seven."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The guys laboratory,Howard,Four.

Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The guys laboratory,Sheldon,It’s five and a half.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The guys laboratory,Howard,"Son of a bitch, it’s five and a half."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The guys laboratory,Sheldon,BRB. That’s short for be right back. I’m saving so much time.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Amy’s laboratory.,Sheldon,The two signals meet up in the corpus callosum and T equals zero. And I know a boy who just earned a slurp of soup.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Amy’s laboratory.,Amy,"Incredible. Sheldon, I didn’t expect that you could work on both projects, but I, I was wrong."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Amy’s laboratory.,Sheldon,"You know, I felt the same way about the spork. Uh, solids and liquids handled by one utensil? That’ll never work. Spoiler, works."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The guys laboratory.,Leonard,"I got to admit, we didn’t think you’d be able to do two things at once."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The guys laboratory.,Sheldon,"Yeah, I felt the same way about the platypus. You know, bird and mammal in the same creature? No way. And spoiler, way."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,Hey.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Hey.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,"Oh, thanks again for letting me use your laptop last night."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,No problem.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,Was just doing my taxes.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Okay.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,"Actually, if I could, if I could just check one more…"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Already cleared the browser history.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,You’re a good woman. What you working on?
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Trying to catch up on office e-mails before I go back.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,"Oh, that’s right, maternity leave’s almost over. Ah, you excited?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Yeah, I mean, I’ll miss Halley, but it’ll be nice to get out of the house, be intellectually stimulated. Go out to lunch instead of, you know, be lunch."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,"That’s great, good for you."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Yeah, I mean, with you and my parents, she’s gonna be fine."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,"Ah, of course she is."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,And that day care is great.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,"It is. I went to check it out, and they are very cautious about letting strange men with no kids peek in the windows."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Plus, I, I think I’m setting a good example for Halley, to show her that women can be mothers and still have satisfying careers. Sure, she won’t know where I went or if I’m ever coming back. That’ll just make the ten minutes between when I get home and her bedtime even more special."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,"Uh, other than burp you or give you a bottle, I don’t know what to do right now."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"It’s okay, I’m just being emotional about this. Can you not tell Howard?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,"Well, don’t you think it’d be healthier if you told him what’s going on with you?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Don’t you think it’d be healthier if you had your own apartment, grown man?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,Your secret is safe with me.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The laundry room.,Penny,"Hey, since when do you do laundry on a Thursday?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The laundry room.,Sheldon,"Oh, I had an accident at work, I slipped and fell on my soup sack."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The laundry room.,Penny,"You know, there was a time I would say what’s a soup sack? But I’m glad we’re past that.(Sheldon sneezes)You know, there was a time I would say God bless you, and then you would say if you must invoke an imaginary deity, how about Thor? And I would say, how do you know I didn’t mean Thor? And then you would say Touché, and that there ends the tale of why I no longer say"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The laundry room.,,God bless you.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The laundry room.,Sheldon,"Well, we have had some fun, haven’t we?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The laundry room.,Penny,"Oh, yeah. So, Leonard tells me you’ve had a busy day."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The laundry room.,Sheldon,"Hmm? Oh, I did. It hasn’t stopped. I figured out a solution for our navigation system while I was pre-soaking lentils out of my pants."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The laundry room.,Penny,Are you getting sick?
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The laundry room.,Sheldon,Of course not. I’m too busy to be sick.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The laundry room.,Penny,"Well, you’re pretty delicate. Maybe you shouldn’t be pushing yourself so hard."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The laundry room.,Sheldon,I’m fine.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The laundry room.,Penny,"All right. Well, we’ll just pretend that you didn’t catch a cold watching Frozen."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The laundry room.,Sheldon,That didn’t happen.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The laundry room.,Penny,You also got a nosebleed watching Up.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The laundry room.,Sheldon,Just do your laundry.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Stuart, you didn’t have to make dinner."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,"Yeah, well, I felt bad about upsetting you this morning. And to be honest, I’m not the biggest fan of your meatloaf."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Hey, what’s for dinner?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Meatloaf.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Oh, cool."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Stuart made it.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Oh, cool. Hey, I was thinking maybe we take Halley to the zoo this weekend, get in a little family time before you go back to work."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Sounds great.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Speaking of which, for day care, it’ll be easy for me to drop her off, unless you want to do it."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Hmm, guess it should be me."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,I can’t do it. They have a picture of me on file now.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,You okay?
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Of course, why?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Well, I don’t know, you seem a little upset."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"No, I’m fine."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,You sure?
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,"Why don’t you think she’s fine? She sounds fine, she looks fine. If I saw her on the street I’d say, damn, that girl’s fine."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Sheldon, you’re sick, go back to bed."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"I am fine. Here, eat your toast.(Sneezes)Sorry."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"It’s okay, now I don’t need butter."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, perhaps I am a little under the weather. It’s nothing a little cold medicine and tea can’t fix."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,You need sleep.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,What I need is to get to work.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Well, I don’t want your germs around me."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"What? You hold my hand, you kiss my mouth, but you draw the line at a hundred and two fever? What happened to our love?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Amy,"Sheldon, are you okay?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,What’s going on? How’d I get here?
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Leonard,"I don’t know, we came home from work and we found you."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Home from work? What time is it?
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Penny,It’s nine o’clock.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Nine o’clock? What happened to eight and seven and all the other o’clocks?
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Raj,"Wait, you don’t remember?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, I remember waking up in the morning, Amy rubbing Vicks on my chest. And her hands were like two frozen chunks of tundra. I took some cold medicine to… I took cold medicine."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Leonard,You did seem a little loopy when you showed up at the lab.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"At, at the lab? Why am I naked from the waist down?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Raj,"I don’t know where your pants are, but we did find your underwear in a pot on the stove."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"My pants are missing, I don’t remember anything. Penny, this is your youth. What do I do?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Penny,"I don’t know, check your body for tattoos?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Leonard, would you be a lamb?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Leonard,She’s kidding.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Wait, wait. Where’s my bag? My phone and my wallet are in my bag."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Raj,It’s right here.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Where’s my notebook? My notebook’s gone. Oh, no."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Penny,"Okay, it’s just a notebook, what’s the big deal?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,What’s the big deal? It’s full of classified information about the air force project.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Leonard,How could you lose that?
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Amy,"It’s okay, I’m sure we’ll find it."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Penny,"Look, it’s got to be around here somewhere."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Amy,Maybe it’s wherever your pants are.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Raj,"Nope, pants in the microwave, no notebook."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,Hey.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,"Ah, hello."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Look, something’s going on with Bernadette. She say anything to you?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,"Well, nope, not a word."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Come on, be honest. Did you tell her I tried her breast pump?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,"No, but I did mention it to my therapist."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Well, I know she’s mad at me about something."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,"Well, what have you done that would upset her?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Oh, gosh, how much time do you have?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,"Well, why don’t you just start with the worst thing?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Hmm, let’s see. Mm. Okay, here we go, six years ago, I got a call that Bernie’s great-aunt, Trixie, died."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,And?
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,And I forgot to give her the message.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,That’s terrible.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"The terrible part is, ever since then, I’ve been sending Bernie Christmas cards from Trixie."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,Oh Howard.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Let me finish, and one card had five dollars in it I took from Bernie’s purse."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Penny,The notebook isn’t in the bathroom.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Amy,"I can’t find it, either. How can he not remember a day?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Penny,"Well, people who are abducted by aliens lose time. I mean, maybe it happens to the aliens, too."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Well, it’s not across the hall."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,That’s it. I’m in breach of my security clearance. I’m going to prison. And you know what happens to people like me in prison. I’ll be forced to be some large man’s tutor.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Raj,You’re not going to prison.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Leonard,"But, boy, it is funny to think about."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Amy,You really can’t remember anything?
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,I’m trying.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Raj,"Wait a minute. Hey, let me see your phone."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Why?
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Raj,"Well, it’s, it’s possible it was tracking everywhere you went."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Amy,Phones can do that?
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Raj,"Yeah, it depends on the privacy settings."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Penny,"Oh, that, that’s so cool. How do you, how do you turn that thing off?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Relax. I know when you go for a run, you stop for a donut."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Penny,"I don’t even run there, I drive."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Raj,"Hang on, I can see every place you went."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,What does it say?
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Raj,"Uh, you were in the building, you were at the university, then you were somewhere on Colorado Boulevard."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Where?
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Raj,"Wait, hang on. Did you go to a cowboy bar?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"I, no, that is preposterous. Maybe."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Hey, how’s it going?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Fine.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,Good. Love you.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Love you, too."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,Love you more.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Okay, you won. Can I finish what I’m doing?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Sure, sorry."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Something on your mind?
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"No, no, nothing. Okay, well, maybe I’m just feeling like something’s bothering you."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Nope, all good."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Prove it, make love to me right now on the kitchen floor."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"No, what is wrong with you?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Aha, you are upset. I don’t know a lot about women, but I know I upset them."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Howard, I’m sorry if I’m being weird, but it has nothing to do with you."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,It doesn’t?
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"No. I didn’t want to tell you, but I’m having a really tough time about going back to work."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Oh. Okay, well, I get that. It was hard for me when I went back."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,It was?
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,Of course. I missed you and the baby and being able to watch Ellen every day.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"I just don’t know what the right thing to do is. If I go back to work, I’m abandoning Halley. If I don’t go, I’m giving up everything I worked for. It’s like there’s no right choice."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Look, I don’t know what the best decision is, either. But whatever we choose, if we’re not happy, we can undo it."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,I guess.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"And the best part is Halley won’t remember a thing. Babies are cute, but they’re dumb. I mean, I go like this, she thinks I’m gone, then magically I’m back. I mean honestly, why are we saving for college?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,I’m not crazy about you calling our baby dumb.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,,"Howard; Well, she gets it from me. Speaking of which, I have some news about your Aunt Trixie."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,A cowboy bar.,Raj,Does this place look familiar?
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,A cowboy bar.,Sheldon,It’s hard to say.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,A cowboy bar.,Barman,"Hey, Sheldon’s back."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,A cowboy bar.,Bar patrons,Sheldon!
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,A cowboy bar.,Sheldon,It’s getting clearer.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,A cowboy bar.,Barman,You gonna buy another round for the house?
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,A cowboy bar.,Sheldon,"Uh, no, thank you. We now know why MasterCard sent me a fraud alert."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,A cowboy bar.,Leonard,Ask him.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,A cowboy bar.,Sheldon,"Um, yes. Howdy, partner. Do you happen to recollect if I left a notebook in these here parts?"
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,A cowboy bar.,Raj,These here parts?
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,A cowboy bar.,Sheldon,"It’s called fitting in. By the way, good luck."
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,A cowboy bar.,Barman,Here you go.
Series 10,Episode 20,The Recollection Dissipation,A cowboy bar.,Sheldon,"Oh, thank goodness."

Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Now, I’m sure many of you are wondering how Fun with Flags began."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"So let’s hear from some people who were there at the very start. How, Howard, flashback sounds."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Could have played that on my harp.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,Just roll the clip.(On voiceover) Sotell us in your own words about that magical moment when Fun with Flags was born.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Leonard,I honestly don’t remember.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Sure you do. I was telling you both the story about how Haiti and Lichtenstein discovered they had the same flag. It was at the Summer Olympics of 1936, and two plucky nations…"

Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Howard and Bernadette’s van.,Howard,You want to hear my Stuart? It’s been a while since I’ve gone on a date. You mind if we watch the monkeys doing it?
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Howard and Bernadette’s van.,Stuart,I said that to you in confidence.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Howard and Bernadette’s van.,Howard,This is supposed to be our family fun day. What’s so important on your phone?
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Howard and Bernadette’s van.,Bernadette,I’m on the day care’s website.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Howard and Bernadette’s van.,Howard,Stop looking at that. The day care’s great. It’s on campus. My office is two minutes away. There’s nothing to worry about.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Howard and Bernadette’s van.,Bernadette,What if she likes the people who work there more than us?
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Howard and Bernadette’s van.,Howard,She already likes soap bubbles more than us.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Howard and Bernadette’s van.,Bernadette,"When I go back to work, we’re gonna leave her with these people. We don’t know anything about them."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Howard and Bernadette’s van.,Howard,They’re highly-trained educators with background checks. They’re even required to be current on all vaccinations.

Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Yeah, which he rudely announced on my flag show. People were so upset about it no one else called in the rest of the night."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The cafeteria.,Bert,Sorry. I couldn’t help myself. I guess I just love love.

Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The Zoo.,Howard,How about after this we go see the exotic bird show?
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The Zoo.,Stuart,Not a good idea. My hair is a coveted nesting material.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The Zoo.,Howard,Learning anything?
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The Zoo.,Bernadette,"Well, sloth babies cling to their mothers’ bodies for almost a year. I’m going back to work after only four months, so I’ve learned I hate myself, I hate sloths, and I hate you for bringing me here."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The Zoo.,Howard,"Me I get, but that sloth is pretty cute."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The Zoo.,Bernadette,It’s not just the sloth. Polar bears nurse their cubs for almost eight months. The orangutan mother builds her baby a new home every night. And what do I do? I choose my career over my child.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The Zoo.,Stuart,Told you we should have gone to Legoland.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Raj,Can’t believe Bert has a girlfriend and I don’t.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Amy,I thought you were taking a break from women to focus on your career.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Raj,"Oh, grow up."

Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Sheldon,She’s younger and far more attractive than he is. They’re copying you two.

Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"No, I’ll be fine."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,"It might be good for her. Howard’s mother was around him all the time, and he’s a world-class mama’s boy."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"I mean, why would you say that?"
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,"Go ahead, have a tantrum, that’ll prove me wrong."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,It would be nice to raise Halley to be a little more independent than you were.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,I guess. It wasn’t until college that I learned you can put a thermometer in your mouth.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,"On that charming note, dinner is served."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Penny,So is this your first time dating a scientist? ‘Cause I’m thinking of starting a support group.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Rebecca,"Actually, I’m not new to this. I was engaged to a Scientologist."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Bert, Rebecca. I’d like to apologize for my insensitive comment earlier."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Rebecca,Don’t worry about it. It’s fine.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Sheldon,See? It was fine. I didn’t need a time-out.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Amy,It wasn’t a time-out. Let’s get some food.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Sheldon,You made me sit on the stairs and think about what I did.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Amy,Get your food.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Raj,So how did you two meet?
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Rebecca,"Oh, it’s such a cute story. We met on a dating Web site."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Leonard,Is that it?
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Rebecca,"Oh, sorry. The end."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Raj,That’s nice. I haven’t had much success meeting people online.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Bert,"I didn’t either, until I revamped my profile."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"What’d you do, delete your photo?"
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Amy,Go.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Fine.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Amy,And don’t you slam that door.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Aw, man."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Rebecca,Did I say something wrong?
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Leonard,"No, it’s always him."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Penny,", Bert, you were telling us how you updated your profile?"
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Bert,"Right. I wasn’t getting any responses, and then I added recent $625,000 MacArthur grant winner, and five minutes later I met my soul mate."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Amy,I was wrong. You can come back in.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Leonard,"So, Rebecca, how did you become a personal trainer?"
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Rebecca,"I came to Los Angeles to be an actress, and things didn’t really work out."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"I’d say she’s copying you again, but I’m getting tired of sitting in the hall."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Raj,I’d love a personal trainer. I haven’t seen my abs since they opened a Shake Shack on my drive home.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Rebecca,I could give you some free sessions.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Penny,"Oh, is that offer for everybody?"
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Leonard,Nice try. I’m not going.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Rebecca,Where’s your bathroom?
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Leonard,"Mm, just down there."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Bert,"She’s so perfect, sometimes I think she isn’t real. And then she goes to the bathroom, and I know she is."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Penny,"Aw, that’s so weird."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Amy,"I’m sorry, Bert, but aren’t you worried she’s only with you for your money?"
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Bert,"She better be. On our first date, I bought her an 80-inch flat-screen."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Sheldon,Your first date? Did you even measure her walls?
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Penny,"You know, on our first date, Leonard used a coupon to buy me a pretzel."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Leonard,And we lived happily ever after.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Penny,The end.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Well, guess I’m ready to go."

Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Okay. Okay, sweetie, Mommy’s gonna go to work now, so you have fun today."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"I told her if day care is anything like prison, find the biggest baby and knock him out."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,"Bye, cutie. I’m gonna miss you. I’m gonna be waiting right here tonight when you get home."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Stop, you’re gonna make me cry."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Great, now everybody’s crying."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,At least Halley’s not.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,That’s good.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"She’s not gonna see us all day, and she doesn’t even care."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,Who’s ready to laugh?
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The cafeteria.,Leonard,O-o-o-o-oh.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"Okay. So, Feynman, Einstein and Schrodinger walk into a bar. Feynman says, it appears"
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The cafeteria.,,"we’re inside a joke. Einstein replies, but only to an observer who saw us walk in simultaneously. To which Schrodinger says, if someone’s looking in the window, I’m leaving."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The cafeteria.,Leonard,That’s actually funny.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The cafeteria.,Raj,You should send that to Jimmy Fallon.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The cafeteria.,Bert,Hey.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"Oh, hello. Join us."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The cafeteria.,Raj,"Hey. Yeah. Hey, sorry if last night was awkward."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The cafeteria.,Bert,"Actually, it got me thinking that I shouldn’t flaunt my money to find love. I might break up with Rebecca."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"Wow, that’s a big step."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The cafeteria.,Raj,I think it shows a lot of character.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The cafeteria.,Bert,I’m gonna hold out and see if I can find a hot young blonde who likes me for me.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"That’s a good one. Okay, now, Leonard, you tell a joke."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The daycare.,Bernadette(on phone),How’s she doing?
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The daycare.,Howard,She’s great. Look.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The daycare.,Bernadette,"I see a wall, floor, some Asian baby, there she is."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The daycare.,Howard,See? Nothing to worry about.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The daycare.,Bernadette,"Thank you. Okay, I’m gonna try and get some work done."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The daycare.,Howard,"Yeah, me, too. Love you."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The daycare.,Bernadette,"Love you, too. Bye."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The daycare.,Stuart,How is she?
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The daycare.,Howard,What are you doing here?
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The daycare.,Stuart,Can’t a guy hang out at a college he doesn’t go to and stare at a baby that isn’t his?
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The daycare.,Howard,I get it. I haven’t even made it to my office yet.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The daycare.,Stuart,Is it weird if we just stand here and watch her all day?
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The daycare.,Howard,Probably. We should go.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The daycare.,Stuart,Yeah. Or we could take her to the aquarium.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The daycare.,Howard,"I’ll get her, you grab her bag."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The daycare.,Stuart,"Hang on, Halley, we’re busting you out of there."

Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Bert,It’s Bert.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Penny,I think it’s Bert.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Raj,"Hey, what’s up?"
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Bert,I broke up with Rebecca.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Penny,Oh.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Amy,"Oh. You know, good for you."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Bert,"No, I miss her. I don’t know why I listened to you."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Sheldon,He’s not wrong. It was your crackpot idea that he deserves love.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Amy,"You know, you need to start raising your hand before you speak. Yes, starting now."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Penny,"Bert, you’re a good guy, you deserve a woman who’s interested in more than just your money."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Bert,She was also interested in walking around my house in her underwear. Now the only one doing that is me.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Leonard,"If you’re that upset, go get her back."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Bert,I tried. She’s not answering my calls. Which really hurts because I bought her that phone. I made a huge mistake.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Raj,"No, you didn’t. Okay? Look, Bert, when I had money, I dated lots of girls who weren’t right for me. And then I gave up my money, and now I’m alone and living with my friends, and somebody else should probably talk now."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Penny,"Look, sweetie, relationships aren’t about money, okay? It’s about respect and having things in common and… yes, Sheldon?"
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Sheldon,You and Leonard don’t have anything in common. Maybe you should break up.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Leonard,You called on him.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Stuart,Guess who’s home from day care?
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,It’s Halley. Unless somebody else put an X on the bottom of their kid’s foot.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,You realize they called when you took her.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,Guess who’s home from the aquarium?
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Bert,Sorry again for barging in.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Leonard,You don’t have to go. You’re welcome to hang with us.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Actually, our friendship group is at capacity. But if anybody drops out, you’re at the top of the list. Unless it’s Raj, in which case, we’ll probably get a person of colour."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Bert,"You guys are nice, but I’m just gonna buy Rebecca a Jet Ski and see if that gets her back."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Raj,I feel bad for Bert.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Sheldon,So he’s using his money to attract a mate. Is that any different than me using my intelligence to attract Amy? Or Leonard using his power of grovelling to get Penny?
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Leonard,"It’s totally different. Bert’s money might run out, but I can beg until the end of time."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Penny,All that and he’s shorter than me.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Raj,"Sheldon, what did Amy have that attracted you?"
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, so many things. Her mind, her kindness, and especially her body."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Raj,Really?
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The apartment.,Amy,Relax. We’re the same blood type. He knew he could harvest an organ.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The daycare.,Howard,She does look happy.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The daycare.,Bernadette,See? This is the right thing for her. Let’s all just go to work.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The daycare.,Stuart,Any time.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,The daycare.,Bernadette,"Let me just say good-bye. Halley. Look at Mommy. Over here, honey. Say good-bye to Mommy. Look at me. Look at your mother. All right, we can go."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,And I’m Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Based on the glowing reception of our recent Behind the Flags retrospective, we thought you might like to see how it all came together."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"So welcome to tonight’s episode,"
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Together,Fun with Flags: Behind the Behind the Flags: A Retrospective Retrospective.
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Ooh, we already have our first call."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Oh. Hello, you’re on Fun with Flags."
Series 10,Episode 21,The Separation Agitation,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Bert,The Jet Ski worked. I got her back.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Leonard,We’re pinned down.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Howard,We can’t get through.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Raj,"Sheldon, get over here and help."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Okay, one second."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Leonard,"Sheldon, why are you jumping up and down?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Sheldon,I’m trying to shoot.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Howard,"Then use the shoot button, not the wonderful thing about Tiggers button."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Leonard,Aw.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Raj,"That’s it, we’re dead."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Howard,"Okay, challenge them again."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Leonard,"Doing it right now. Oh, they can’t. There’s an important Little League game tomorrow."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Howard,"No wonder they beat us, they’re jocks."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Sheldon,What happened to me? I used to excel at these things.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Howard,Kids are always better at video games.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, I don’t like it."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Leonard,"Mm, if it makes you feel better, you still dress like a child."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Sheldon,"No, but it’s not just video games. I downloaded the new O.S. for my phone, took me a week to stop accidentally texting kissy faces to everyone."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Howard,"Oh, so our love is not real?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Raj,"Well, I know how you feel. I tried one of those electronic Japanese toilets, practically shot myself across the room."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Sheldon,"I guess I just need to face it, I’m no longer a wunderkind. Now I just wonder what’s for lunch."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Leonard,Hot dogs.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Sheldon,Yay.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,,Credits sequence.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,A bar.,Penny,I didn’t know you could drink while you’re breastfeeding.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,A bar.,Bernadette,"Yeah, they say the yeast in beer helps with milk production."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,A bar.,Amy,"I’m pretty sure that’s a myth, let me check."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,A bar.,Bernadette,Ruin it for me and I’ll break this glass over your head.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,A bar.,Amy,To denial.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,A bar.,Penny,Ooh. I’m gonna get another. You want food?
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,A bar.,Bernadette,"Yeah, breastfeeding burns, like, 5,000 calories a day. Do not touch that phone."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,A bar.,Zack,Penny?
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,A bar.,Penny,"Oh, Zack. Hey."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,A bar.,Zack,What are the odds of running into you here?
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,A bar.,Penny,"Well, it’s a bar, so pretty good. Uh, what’s new?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,A bar.,Zack,"Oh, tons of stuff. Put artificial grass in my backyard, got engaged, had a scary mole that turned out to be Sharpie."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,A bar.,Penny,"Well, congratulations."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,A bar.,Zack,That’s what my dermatologist said.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,A bar.,Penny,"No, on, on getting engaged, good for you."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,A bar.,Zack,"Oh, thanks. How about you? Hey, how’s Leonard? Is he still smart?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,A bar.,Penny,"Yes, yes, he’s working for the government on an infinite persistence gyroscope. Of course, the first time I say it right, he’s not even here."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,A bar.,Zack,"I love that little guy. Hey, we should all have dinner sometime."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,A bar.,Penny,"Uh, yeah, sure, I’ll check with Leonard."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,A bar.,Zack,"Cool, I’ll check with Sara. Sara, pull up my calendar. It never works for me."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The comic book store.,Sheldon,I’ve been thinking about our recent humiliation.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The comic book store.,Leonard,You’re gonna have to be more specific.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The comic book store.,Sheldon,At the hands of those teenagers.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The comic book store.,Leonard,More.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The comic book store.,Sheldon,Boy teenagers.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The comic book store.,Leonard,"Oh, the video game. Yeah, that was bad."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The comic book store.,Sheldon,"I started doing some reading on cognitive vitality, and I came across an area of research called super-aging."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The comic book store.,Raj,"You know who’s a super-ager? Jennifer Lopez. Like, what is her secret?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The comic book store.,Howard,"Now, this is rare. I don’t know which one of you I want to stop talking first."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The comic book store.,Sheldon,"The theory is that if you really tax your brain, the neurofibers will become thicker and the glial cells more lustrous."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The comic book store.,Raj,Like J-Lo’s hair.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The comic book store.,Howard,"Boy, it is neck and neck right now."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The comic book store.,Leonard,"How is super-aging any different than, like, doing crossword puzzles?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The comic book store.,Sheldon,"Well, it’s not just doing simple cognitive tasks. You need to push your brain out of its comfort zone and reach mental exhaustion."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The comic book store.,Leonard,"I drive you to work every day, my brain must look like the Hulk."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The comic book store.,Raj,"If you really want to challenge yourself, you could learn to speak Hindi."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The comic book store.,Sheldon,Jab mein aat saal ka tha maine seekha tha. (I did that when I was eight)
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The comic book store.,Raj,"Could you say that in English? I actually, I never learned Hindi."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Penny,"Hey, you ready to go?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Leonard,"Yeah, I guess."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Penny,What’s the matter?
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Leonard,"Honestly? It’s a little strange having dinner with your ex-boyfriend, and it’s not like we have a lot to talk about."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Penny,"What? He loves you, okay? And he’s interested in your work. You could talk about the infinite perspective… I swear I know it."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Leonard,"It’ll be fine, let’s just go."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Penny,"Well, and his fiancée will be there, so you know, if the conversation lags, we can talk about their wedding."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Leonard,Aaargh.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Penny,"Come on, I spent an entire plane ride with you talking about the trailer for Deadpool 2."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Leonard,"Ha, I knew you weren’t asleep."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,A restaurant.,Zack,"Hey, guys."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,A restaurant.,Penny,"Hi. Hey, where’s your fiancée?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,A restaurant.,Zack,"Oh, she couldn’t make it. She had an emergency."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,A restaurant.,Penny,"Oh, no, what happened?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,A restaurant.,Zack,I didn’t ask.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Hey.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,Hey.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Raj,Hey.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,What smells so good?
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,Raj is teaching me to make croissants.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Is this part of your super-aging?
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Yes. Yeah, it seemed daunting at first, but then I realized, it’s like the chemistry set I had as a kid. Only, when your brother eats this, no one has to call Poison Control."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Raj,"Okay. Shall we? Oh, my God. It’s light, it’s flaky, it’s buttery. You don’t need to have sex with him, just eat one of these."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Yes, it is delicious. Physicist, baker, lover, what can’t I do?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Well, clearly mental tasks are not enough. Maybe you need to challenge your motor skills."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"For the last time, I am not having a tickle fight with you."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Raj,"You want a real challenge, try keeping me from eating more of these."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,You’re just using food to mask the fear that you’re fundamentally unlovable and therefore going to be alone forever.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Raj,"Damn it, he’s good at that, too."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The restaurant.,Zack,"Thanks. Wow, working on a top secret government project, that is so cool. Do you have a bodyguard to keep spies away?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The restaurant.,Leonard,"I have Sheldon, that keeps most people away."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The restaurant.,Zack,"I miss that guy. He’s like the Swedish Chef Muppet. I don’t know what he’s saying, but he’s funny."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The restaurant.,Leonard,"Oh, I know what he’s saying, and he’s not, he’s not funny."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The restaurant.,Zack,"So, Penny, what’s going on with you? How’s the job?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The restaurant.,Penny,"Uh, it’s okay, I’m still in pharmaceutical sales."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The restaurant.,Leonard,"She’s doing amazing. She can actually make a side effect, like 10% chance of liver failure, sound like a 90% chance of liver success."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The restaurant.,Penny,"Yeah, lying isn’t my favourite part of the job. Actually, I’m not crazy about a lot of it."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The restaurant.,Zack,"Hey, if you’re not happy there, I’ve been looking for a new head of sales at my company. And we don’t sell drugs, just menus, so the only lie you’ll be telling is we print on recycled paper. We don’t."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The restaurant.,Penny,"Oh, that’s a nice offer."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The restaurant.,Zack,"You know, we’d make a great team. Or as we say in the menu business, I can’t do this without Me N U."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The restaurant.,Penny,"Right, ’cause it spells menu."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The restaurant.,Zack,"Yeah, right? It’s funny. I got a lot of menu jokes, but that’s my favourite."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"All right, this is everything. What do you want to learn?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Sheldon,"It really doesn’t matter, as long as it’s challenging."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Okay, well, how about, oh, I teach you some close-up magic."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Sheldon,"Howard, I’m trying to make myself uncomfortable, not everyone else."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,So you wanted to learn something physical and you came to Howard Wolowitz?
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Hey, the circus arts are very physically and mentally demanding. Have you ever tried to juggle?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Yes, I’m juggling my love for you and my embarrassment of you right now."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"And it’s hard, isn’t it? So the key is, the moment one ball is at the top of its arc, you toss the next one. Hmm?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Sheldon,"Okay, I think I got that."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Uh, hold on. There’s an old saying in juggling."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Is it I’m going to die alone?
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"No, it’s if you want to have fun, start with one. Yours we think, but we do not say. All right, just toss it up and catch it a few times, get comfortable with it."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Sheldon,"Okay. Just to be on the safe side, am I in any danger of getting juggler’s elbow?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,No.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Sheldon,Are you sure? ‘Cause I’m feeling a twinge.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Penny’s car.,Penny,"See, that wasn’t so bad. He even picked up the check."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Penny’s car.,Leonard,"Yeah. Although, when he was trying to figure out the tip, I’m pretty sure I saw smoke coming out of his ears. You’re not really considering working for him, are you?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Penny’s car.,Penny,"Well, maybe, I mean, it seems kind of perfect. I have sales experience, and I’ve been a waitress, so I have restaurant experience, and if he’s figuring out my Christmas bonus, we could buy a boat."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Penny’s car.,Leonard,Don’t you think it might be a little weird to work for someone you used to date?
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Penny’s car.,Penny,"You work with Sheldon, you tell me."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Penny’s car.,Leonard,"Yeah, it’s weird."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Penny’s car.,Penny,"Okay, are you seriously jealous of me working with Zack?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Penny’s car.,Leonard,"No, no, I’m not jealous, I just think you have got a good thing going where you are right now, and you make great money and you haven’t slept with any of your co-workers."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Penny’s car.,Penny,"Great, so you want me to stay at a job I’m not happy at?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Penny’s car.,Leonard,Uh.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Penny’s car.,Penny,You okay? You kind of look like Zack trying to figure out that tip.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Penny’s car.,Leonard,"Of course I don’t want you to be unhappy, but I also want you to be smart, and working for an ex-boyfriend isn’t very smart. You don’t have to stop, just slow down, I’ll jump out."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Amy, look, I’m on a unicycle!"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,How did you get from croissants to a unicycle?
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,I hurt myself juggling.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Where did you get it?
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Howard said I could borrow it, Bernadette said forever."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Have you tried letting go of the rope?
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"What, are you crazy? I’m on a unicycle."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"All right, well, have fun."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Wait, I need help getting down."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Well, what do you want me to do?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Drag out our mattress and put it over here, then go across the hall, get their mattress and put it over here. But before you do any of that, scratch my nose."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Howard,So you told her she was being dumb?
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Leonard,"No, I told her she was being not smart. Which was dumb."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Raj,Why did you even go to dinner with the guy?
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Leonard,"We covered this, I’m dumb."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Penny,"So he’s my ex-boyfriend, who cares? I can’t believe Leonard would be so insecure."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Really? I have no trouble believing that at all.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Penny,And Zack’s engaged. Leonard has no reason to feel threatened.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"We’re talking about the same Leonard, right?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Leonard,So you think it’s fine if she works for Zack?
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Howard,"I don’t know, maybe."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Raj,"Well, he is much more attractive than Leonard."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Howard,"Yes, but that’s gonna be true of a lot of guys she works for."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Leonard,"Yeah, but she also used to sleep with Zack."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Howard,Again.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,I would never let Howard work with an ex.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Penny,"What, you wouldn’t trust him?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,I wouldn’t trust her. He’s thin and sexy like a Jewish greyhound.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Penny,"Yeah, that, that is the sexiest dog."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,And I’d like to think Howie wouldn’t take a job I was uncomfortable with.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Penny,‘Cause he’s scared of you?
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Terrified.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Penny,Yeah.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Howard,"You know what? I’m with Leonard, this isn’t cool."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Leonard,Thank you.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Raj,"I disagree. Penny is a strong, independent woman. The more you try to control her, the more she’ll push back."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Leonard,So you think it’s okay?
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Raj,"Oh, no, she’s gonna leave you for someone, might as well get it over with."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,What are you doing?
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,I’m returning this stuff to Howard.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Oh. Well, Bernadette made me promise if you didn’t want it, we’d give it to a homeless clown. What happened to learning the unicycle?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, I stopped that, it was dumb. Uni, bi, tri, menstrual, all cycles are dumb."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"You said juggling was dumb, too."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, it is. If I wanted to hold three things at once, I’d wear cargo pants."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Sheldon, is it possible that when things get really difficult, you just give up?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,Are you calling me a quitter?
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Well, if you honestly…"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,This conversation is over.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"His mother warned me. Everybody warned me. Actually, he warned me."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Penny,Hey.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Leonard,Hi.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Penny,You want to talk?
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Leonard,That doesn’t seem to be where I shine. How about I just give you one of these?
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Penny,"Look, we can have a reasonable conversation and I won’t get mad. I don’t like it after sex, and I don’t like it now."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Leonard,"Yeah, sorry."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Penny,"Yeah. All right, just come here. Look, I get me working with Zack is weird and I don’t want you to be uncomfortable."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Leonard,"Well, thanks. And I don’t want you to be stuck at a job you don’t like."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Penny,Then what do we do?
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Leonard,"Well, I don’t love it, but if you really want to take this job, I’ll find a way to deal with it."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Penny,"No, I know you’ll try, but it’ll make you miserable, which will make me miserable, and I’m just gonna stay where I’m at for now."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Leonard,"No, no, no, no, you’re, you’re unhappy there and then you’re gonna blame me for making you stay, and it’s fine, I’ll just, I’ll suck it up."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Penny,"You don’t need to do that, it’s okay."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Leonard,"Yeah, see, now I feel terrible, like I’m being selfish and holding you back. What? Say something. Yeah, that is pretty annoying."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,I made you tea.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,Thank you.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,I’m sorry I called you a quitter.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"It’s okay, I stopped being upset about that. And no, the irony is not lost on me."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,What are you reading?
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,This article says the peak age for making a Nobel Prize-winning discovery is 40.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,So?
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,So I’m running out of time.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,"That’s ridiculous, you’re a brilliant man. The best years of your life are still ahead of you."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"Oh, you have to say that, you’re sweet on me."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,"Well, if you’re really worried about your career, maybe you should consider spending a little less time with video games and comic books."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,"Hey, I thought you were sweet on me."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,"Okay, fine, let’s say you never win a Nobel Prize. Let’s say you spend your life doing solid scientific research surrounded by friends and loved ones who appreciate you, not for what you’ve accomplished but for who you are as a man. Wouldn’t that be a life well-lived?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Sheldon,You’re so cute. I’m gonna go learn how to walk on stilts.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Sheldon and Amy’s bedroom.,Amy,So many warnings.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Penny,"Okay, are you sure about this?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Leonard,Absolutely. I just want you to be happy. And maybe a little turned on about how selfless I’m being.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Zack(on phone),"Penny, what’s up?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Penny,"Hey, uh, so I’ve been thinking about it and I want to take the job."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Zack,"Oh, bad news. When my fiancée found out that I was offering a job to my ex-girlfriend, she said it was a stupid idea and threw a shoe at me."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Penny,"Oh, so there’s no job?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Zack,"Nope, just a little bump on my forehead."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Penny,"Okay, thanks anyway. Bye. Well, his fiancée thought the idea of us working together was stupid. You were right, I was wrong. Aren’t you gonna say anything?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,The apartment.,Leonard,Not if I want to be doing this later.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Hey, I didn’t know you were home. Where you been?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,I went to see your mom.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Seriously, where were you?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"I just told you, your mom’s."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Why?
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Well, since you find my magic tricks so embarrassing, I got to wondering what cool hobbies you had as a kid."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Oh. What’d she say?
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"She didn’t say much of anything. But she said a lot.(Through ventriloquist’s doll)Hi, Bernadette, remember me?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"First of all, that’s not what she sounds like, she’s from South Carolina."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,I can’t believe you made fun of me all these years while you were a closeted ventriloquist.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Okay, it’s not like I wanted to be a ventriloquist. I was in beauty pageants and I needed a talent besides spreading rumours that the other contestants were pregnant."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Well, since you enjoyed getting rid of all my stuff, you know, maybe we should throw this little lady in the wood chipper."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,No. And the little lady has a name.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,Which is?
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,Tammy Jo St. Cloud.
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"Tammy Jo St. Cloud. Oh, and I’m a dork for juggling."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Sorry, you’re not a dork.(Through doll)You’re a clown.(Bernadette)Tammy Jo, don’t say that, you’ll make him feel bad.(Doll)Look at him, what reason he got to feel good?"
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"All right, very funny."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette,"Don’t listen to her, she’s been in a box for, like, 25 years.(Doll)Yeah, back when his haircut was fashionable."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"That’s enough, put her away."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette(as Doll),"Oh, big daddy, I don’t think so. You marry Miss Bernie, you marry me. We all family now."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Howard,"All right, you’re freaking me out."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.,Bernadette(as Doll),"Don’t be that way. If you don’t mind a few splinters, we can have us a ménage à trois. Ooh."
Series 10,Episode 22,The Cognition Regeneration,A street.,Sheldon,"I’m doing it. I’m doing it. I’m tall and I’m doing it.(Waking up in bed)Ah, man."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,,,After a “previously on” segment.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Penny,"Champagne, champagne."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Leonard,Thank you.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Penny,"And for the world’s tallest second grader, apple juice."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Thank you. No bendy straw, some party."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Leonard,"Hey, a toast. Thank you all for your support while we worked on our Air Force project. And please know that we could not have done it without you, so cheers."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,All,Cheers.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Amy,"You know, it’s nice of you to acknowledge us, but this is your accomplishment."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Bernadette,"Yeah, you guys did this all on your own."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Raj,Without me.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Sheldon,To success without Raj.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Bernadette,So what happens next?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Howard,"Phase two, we test it, perfect it, and hope to live long enough to see the movie based on our lives starring more attractive versions of us."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Yeah, I’ll definitely live long enough. Vitamin C."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Leonard,"First thing tomorrow morning, we’re back at it."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Raj,Without me.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Sheldon,"I hope his character doesn’t make it into the movie, he’s kind of a bummer."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Outside the lab.,Computer Voice,Leonard Hofstadter. Access granted.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Outside the lab.,Leonard,"Hmm. I don’t care if this thing is burning out my retinas, it makes me feel special. Now, before we field test, I think we…"
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Outside the lab.,Howard,What the hell?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Outside the lab.,Leonard,Where is everything?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Outside the lab.,Sheldon,Who else has access to this room?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Outside the lab.,Leonard,"It’s a secure lab in a classified facility, only the U.S. government and us."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Outside the lab.,Sheldon,This is disconcerting.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Outside the lab.,Howard,But the movie did just get good.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Outside the lab.,,Credits sequence.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The laboratory .,Leonard,"Sir, I, I, I’m sorry but I just don’t get it. You came into our lab in the middle of the night and took our prototype and all of our research and didn’t even tell us?"
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The laboratory .,Col. Williams,Sounds like you get it.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The laboratory .,Howard,But why would you do that?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The laboratory .,Col. Williams,"You guys completed phase one, we’ll take it from here."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The laboratory .,Sheldon,Where did you move it?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The laboratory .,Col. Williams,I can’t tell you that.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The laboratory .,Leonard,Are you implementing phase two?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The laboratory .,Col. Williams,I can’t tell you that.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The laboratory .,Sheldon,"Wait, so you’re just going to take all the work we’ve done for the last year and toss us aside?"
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The laboratory .,Col,"Williams: That one I can tell you, yes."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The laboratory .,Howard,This is all very upsetting.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The laboratory .,Col. Williams,"I’m sorry to hear that. As you know, the primary focus of the United States military is people’s feelings."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The laboratory .,Sheldon,"If that’s sarcasm, please save it for our enemies."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Raj,I may be moving out soon. I think I found a place to live.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Penny,"Oh, I’m sorry to hear that."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Raj,Really? You kept sending me apartment listings.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Penny,"Um, well, I, yeah, you got me."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Amy,Where are you moving?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Penny,And when? But also where?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Raj,Bert has a room for rent.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Bernadette,So you’re gonna be roommates with Bert?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Raj,"Uh, no, it’s, uh, pretty private, actually, it’s over his garage. So the only time I’ll see him is when he pulls his car in, does his laundry or practices drums in my dining room."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Amy,"Well, good for you. I actually have a little news myself."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Penny,"Okay, we’re just gonna circle back to when he’s moving out? Okay, that’s cool."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Amy,"I was, uh, asked to be a visiting researcher at Princeton."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Bernadette,"Hey, that’s amazing."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Penny,Good for you.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Raj,Congratulations.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Amy,"Thanks, but the thing is I’ll be gone for a few months and I don’t know how Sheldon’s gonna feel about that."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Penny,"Oh, come on, he’s a grown man, he can take care of himself."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Amy,You really believe that?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Penny,"Once again, you got me."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The stairwell.,Howard,How can you work on something for a year and they just take it?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The stairwell.,Leonard,I can’t believe the Air Force would treat us like that.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"You know, I have a good mind to stop paying my taxes. It’s too bad I enjoy doing them so much. The Air Force did it again. They’re erasing our lives."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Third floor, wrong apartment."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The stairwell.,Howard,"Although, if anyone’s gonna clean out your apartment and disappear, it’d be Penny."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The stairwell.,Leonard,"She might disappear, but she’s definitely not cleaning anything."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Sheldon,"It’s okay, everything’s here."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Penny,"Oh, hey, what’s going on?"
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Leonard,"You won’t believe it, the military confiscated our project."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Penny,What?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Bernadette,You’re kidding. Why would they do that?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Howard,They wouldn’t say.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Sheldon,"I feel so betrayed. You know, all my life I thought Uncle Sam was a friendly uncle who brought you presents. Turns out he’s the other kind."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Amy,"Sheldon, I’m so sorry."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Sheldon,Thank you. Can we just talk about something else?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Leonard,"Yeah, what’s going on with you guys?"
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Howard,Give us some good news.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Penny,Amy’s got some news.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Amy,"Yeah, um, Raj is moving out."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Leonard,"Oh, no. When?"
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Howard and Bernadette’s van.,Bernadette,You doing okay?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Howard and Bernadette’s van.,Howard,Not really.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Howard and Bernadette’s van.,Bernadette,Want me to put on some Neil Diamond? That always makes you feel better.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Howard and Bernadette’s van.,Howard,"No. Then you’ll get all sexed up and I’m not in the mood. I mean, an entire year wasted."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Howard and Bernadette’s van.,Bernadette,You might be forgetting another accomplishment of the past year.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Howard and Bernadette’s van.,Howard,"Oh. Yeah, yeah, we brought life into the world."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Howard and Bernadette’s van.,Bernadette,Really? That’s the importance you put on us having a baby?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Howard and Bernadette’s van.,Howard,"I’m happy about it, but, I mean, it’s not like I did much. I mean, after the first three minutes it was pretty much all you."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Penny(on phone),"So, did you tell him about Princeton yet?"
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Amy,"No, I’m waiting till he’s in a good mood."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Penny,"Oh, sweetie, you might not live that long."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Amy,"I don’t know, maybe I shouldn’t go."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Penny,"Oh, stop it, he’ll be fine."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Amy,I guess. And he’ll have you and Leonard right across the hall the whole time.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,,"Penny; Oh, damn, wait, you know, maybe you shouldn’t go."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Amy,Got to go. Morning.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Sheldon,I apologize for exceeding my allotted bathroom time.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Amy,Are you feeling okay?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Sheldon,Not really. Apparently grief can make one less regular.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Amy,"Oh, I’m sorry to hear that."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Sheldon,"No, I sat and I sat, but to no avail."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Amy,"Oh, the more details, the more sorry. Well, maybe this’ll cheer you up. I made your favorite oatmeal, plain."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Sheldon,What’s the occasion?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Amy,"No occasion, I just wanted to do something nice for you."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Sheldon,"You’re so kind. You know, I don’t know how I ever got by without you."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Amy,"Oh. That’s sweet, but you, you did just fine on your own."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, I thought that, too, but I’ve come to realize, I am completely dependent on you."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Amy,"Sheldon, you’re, you’re being silly."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Sheldon,"No, to wake up every morning and know you’re there is a great comfort to me. Mmm, tasteless. How do you do it?"
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Amy,"You know, what you need to do is put this Air Force project behind you and just dive into something new."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, there is our quantum cognition experiment. You and I could spend more time on that."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Amy,"Oh, I don’t know, I mean, let’s say we succeed in proving that our consciousness creates reality. I mean, what will we have really accomplished? You know, a loaf of bread’s still three bucks."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Sheldon,I’m confused. You’re always saying that you want to spend more time with me.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Amy,"That is true, I have said that."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, a lot, it’s very annoying. Has something changed? Um, is there something that you’re not telling me?"
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Amy,I was offered a summer research fellowship at Princeton.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Princeton? A fine institution. The place where Albert Einstein taught. And where Leonard got his PhD, so it may have gone downhill."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Amy,"Yeah, that’s the one."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, that’s wonderful. Congratulations."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Amy,"Well, I haven’t accepted it yet. I wanted to talk to you first."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Sheldon,What is there to talk about? You have to take it. It’s important.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Amy,So are you.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Thank you, but I’ll be fine."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Amy,"Are, are you sure?"
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Yes. I may have lost my guidance system and my girlfriend, but I still have a colon full of yesterday’s meals to keep me company. Although, thanks to your high fibre breakfast, I’m sure that’ll be leaving me, too."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,A park.,Bernadette,Really? He doesn’t put raisins or banana slices or anything in it?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,A park.,Amy,I don’t think plain oatmeal was the point of that story.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,A park.,Penny,"I mean, I like a little brown sugar."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,A park.,Amy,Guys.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,A park.,Penny,Sorry.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,A park.,Bernadette,"You’re still gonna go, right?"
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,A park.,Amy,I don’t know. Sheldon’s so vulnerable right now.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,A park.,Penny,"Oh, come on. Look, if the roles were reversed, he’d be on the first train to New Jersey, or the second train if there were teenagers on the first one."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,A park.,Bernadette,"Well, distance might be nice. The last time a big project ended for Howie, he wouldn’t stop following me around. He even went with me to get a mammogram."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,A park.,Penny,"Well, what’s wrong with that?"
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,A park.,Bernadette,"No, he wanted to get one with me, like some kind of weird couple’s massage."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,A park.,Penny,And yet you bore his child. Neato.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,A park.,Bernadette,"You’re excited about this opportunity, right?"
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,A park.,Amy,Of course. I get to be part of the first team to use radon markers to map the structures that…
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,A park.,Penny,"Okay, a simple yes will do."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,A park.,Bernadette,You have to go.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,A park.,Amy,"I know, but what if Sheldon…"
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,A park.,Penny,"Okay, listen to me. Your relationship can handle being long distance for a while. It’s not like you two are very physical."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,A park.,Amy,"Hey, you don’t know what goes on behind closed doors."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,A park.,Penny,A lot of lectures?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,A park.,Amy,"All right, so you know."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,A park.,Bernadette,"I’m telling you, if you don’t go you’ll end up regretting it."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,A park.,Howard,"Hey, wait up."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,A park.,Bernadette,"Oh, great."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,A park.,Howard,You left something at home. A big hug.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,A park.,Bernadette,Oh.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,A park.,Howard,I found it right next to these kisses.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,A park.,Bernadette,It’s too late for me. Save yourself.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The stairwell.,Leonard,"So, are you excited to have your own place again?"
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The stairwell.,Raj,"I am, but I’ll miss you guys."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Ah, we’ll miss you, too."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The stairwell.,Raj,You could try saying that without smiling.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The stairwell.,Leonard,I’m trying. This is the best I can do. What are you doing?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The stairwell.,Sheldon,What does it look like? I’m playing sad harmonica in an apartment as empty as my heart.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The stairwell.,Raj,Why?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The stairwell.,Sheldon,I got the blues. My baby done left me.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The stairwell.,Raj,"Come on, Sheldon. Amy’s only gone for a few months. And now that I’m moving out, your old room is empty, so you can stay there whenever you want."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Uh, could I talk to you in the hall for a sec?"
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The stairwell.,Raj,"Yeah, sure."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Sheldon, you’re being silly."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"Am I? Yesterday I had an Air Force project, a girlfriend who lived with me, and my good friend Raj right across the hall."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The stairwell.,Leonard,Do you really care about that last one?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The stairwell.,Sheldon,"No, but that list was sounding a little thin."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The stairwell.,Leonard,"Instead of dwelling on the negative, think about this. Your girlfriend was given an amazing opportunity, which gives you an opportunity to show her that you’re a loving and supportive boyfriend."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The stairwell.,Sheldon,So trick her.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The stairwell.,Leonard,"All right, let me start again. Uh, you and Amy…"
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The stairwell.,Raj(outside),Can I get my stuff? Sounds like it’s gonna be a while.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Howard and Bernadette’s bathroom.,Howard,I missed you.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Howard and Bernadette’s bathroom.,Bernadette,"Come here, let’s talk."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Howard and Bernadette’s bathroom.,Howard,Ooh. Sounds serious. Have I been a bad boy? Am I gonna get a spanking ’cause you know.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Howard and Bernadette’s bathroom.,Bernadette,"Just listen. I don’t know if you realize this, but whenever you’re between projects, you tend to get a little insecure."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Howard and Bernadette’s bathroom.,Howard,Oh.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Howard and Bernadette’s bathroom.,Bernadette,A little clingy.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Howard and Bernadette’s bathroom.,Howard,I know and I’m sorry.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Howard and Bernadette’s bathroom.,Bernadette,"Oh, oh, oh, okay, stop. Stop. I love when you’re affectionate, but this is not coming from a good place."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Howard and Bernadette’s bathroom.,Howard,"Well, excuse me, but what did you do when you worked on that allergy drug for two years and the FDA shut down your project?"
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Howard and Bernadette’s bathroom.,Bernadette,I signed us up for ballroom dance class.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Howard and Bernadette’s bathroom.,Howard,"Okay, and what did you do when they took you off the antifungal team?"
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Howard and Bernadette’s bathroom.,Bernadette,I made us have a baby.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Howard and Bernadette’s bathroom.,Howard,So?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Howard and Bernadette’s bathroom.,Bernadette,Bring it in.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Howard and Bernadette’s bathroom.,Howard,And now the movie just got rated R.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Hey. You going somewhere?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"No, but you are, so I got you this as a present."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Sheldon, that isn’t necessary."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"No, it is. Leonard pointed out to me that I’m not always a loving and supportive boyfriend, so here’s some quality luggage."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Thank you.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"The salesman said it could survive a plane crash, so perhaps you should fly inside it."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Does this mean you’re okay with me going?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, I’m not looking forward to it, but it is a wonderful opportunity and you need to take it. Besides, Princeton is in New Jersey, so it’s not like you’re gonna want to stay. Uh, I know it’s not your birthday, but if you’re interested…"
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,I am.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Okay. Oh, and just to be clear, I’m not being intimate with you in order to keep you from going."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,I wasn’t thinking that.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Well, no, it’s just, I’m just warning you, you know, if you find yourself 3,000 miles away and craving a hit of this, you know, I can’t Skype it to you."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,That’s a risk I’m willing to take.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"All right, then. Let’s go to the bedroom, remove our clothes, fold them neatly and engage in frenzied lovemaking."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,What if we don’t fold our clothes at all?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Or, what if we fold them?"
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment doorway.,Raj,"Well, here’s your key back."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment doorway.,Leonard,Thank you.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment doorway.,Raj,As soon as I have the place set up I’m gonna have you guys over.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment doorway.,Penny,"Oh, we would love that."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment doorway.,Raj,"I really can’t thank you enough for taking me in. You know, I was in a pretty low place in my life."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment doorway.,Sheldon(off),"Oh, Amy, you naughty vixen."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment doorway.,Raj,"Anyway, uh, as I was saying, I was at a pretty low place in my life and, uh, if it wasn’t for friends"
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment doorway.,,like you…
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment doorway.,Amy(off),"My goodness, that form of stimulation is highly efficient."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment doorway.,Raj,I can’t compete with that. Bye.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment doorway.,Leonard,Should we give them their privacy?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment doorway.,Penny,"I want to, but I don’t think I can."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment doorway.,Sheldon(off),Whoopee!
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,The apartment doorway.,Penny,"Okay, I’m good now."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Okay, the car is waiting. Do you want to walk me downstairs?"
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Of course. Here, here, let me. I’ve been doing a little research on New Jersey, and I was delighted to learn that their chief agricultural product is sod."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Is it?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Hmm, yes. Yeah, perhaps I’ve been harder on them than they deserve."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Do you think it’s possible you might enjoy being on your own for a little while?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,It’s hard to say. I’ve never really lived by myself. What if I become strange and eccentric?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,I’ll love you no matter what.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,Howard Hughes saved his urine in milk bottles.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it.

Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,I will.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,And when you’re at the gate?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Uh-huh.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,And if you see any actors from Game of Thrones in first class?
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"I don’t know what they look like, but sure."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,And don’t forget to Skype me when you arrive.

Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,And every morning.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Got it.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Now of course, my 9am is your noon, so let’s avoid the whole good morning, good afternoon minefield, and let’s just say hello."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Good thinking.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"And just remember, I am proud of you and I support you in all that you do."
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Thank you. That means a lot.
Series 10,Episode 23,The Gyroscopic Collapse,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, and one last thing. If you find yourself working with a male scientist who’s as smart as me, as tall as me and has hair like Thor, well, then I want you to step away from the situation and call me immediately."

Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy on skype.,Sheldon,"Now, I’ve learned some fun facts about New Jersey to help you make small talk. Would you like to know the state bird or the murder rate? They’re both shocking."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy on skype.,Amy,"Actually, I want to hear about you. How are things at home?"
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy on skype.,Sheldon,"Well, I’m a lot less likely to see an Eastern Goldfinch or be murdered, I’ll tell you that."

Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy on skype.,Amy,"It’s so strange, earlier today I ended a sentence with a preposition and you weren’t there to correct my grammar."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy on skype.,Sheldon,I’m sorry you had to go through that.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy on skype.,Amy,"In fact, that’s when I started to really miss you."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy on skype.,Sheldon,You know you just split an infinitive.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy on skype.,Amy,Did I? Are you gonna teach me a lesson?
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy on skype.,Sheldon,I am. It is naughty to put an adverb between the word to and the verb stem.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy on skype.,Amy,What are you gonna do about it?
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy on skype.,Sheldon,I’m going to admonish you.

Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,Let’s sit somewhere else.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The cafeteria.,Raj,What just happened?
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The cafeteria.,Howard,A stranger just lured Sheldon away with a candy bar.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"Wait, isn’t she the grad student that used to follow him around?"
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The cafeteria.,Howard,"Oh, yeah. Back before he hit puberty and grew man parts."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The cafeteria.,Raj,So what do you guys think that’s about?
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"Knowing Sheldon, nothing."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,"So, tell me about your scalar dark energy experiment."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The cafeteria.,Ramona,Not ’til you tell me about your latest paper on quantum loop theory.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The cafeteria.,Sheldon,Oh. You must be one of those dessert before dinner people.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"He just made her laugh, something’s wrong."

Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The cafeteria.,Leonard,"Ah, did you see that? She just touched his hand and he didn’t swat it away. What is happening?"
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The cafeteria.,Howard,"Okay, the simplest explanation is usually the right one."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The cafeteria.,Raj,Which is?
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The cafeteria.,Howard,That ain’t Sheldon.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Penny,"Not only did they eat together, Leonard said he made her laugh."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Bernadette,"That’s nothing, Howie said she touched his hand."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Penny,Did he Purell?
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Bernadette,No.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Penny,I cannot believe Leonard mentioned the Toblerone but left that part out.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Bernadette,Should we call Amy?
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Penny,I don’t know; we shouldn’t worry her if it’s nothing.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Bernadette,I guess we could wait till we have more information about this girl.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Penny,Yeah. Do you think living with Amy has somehow stirred up Sheldon’s sexual appetite?
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Bernadette,Ugh. How can you think that? Why would you even put those words together?
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Penny,"All right, then we agree. He’s not making any moves, it’s this Dr. Ramona chick."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Bernadette,"Nowitzki. I googled her, she’s pretty cute."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Penny,Really? All I got from Leonard was the Toblerone bar had nuts.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy on skype.,Sheldon,"And get this, I saw an articulating ladder with dual-leg leveling, which delivers stability and adaptability to uneven terrain."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy on skype.,Amy,Sounds like a big night.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy on skype.,Sheldon,"Yeah. Raj made the funniest joke, he said, which is the best ladder to use to hang myself?"
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy on skype.,Amy,So you’re keeping busy? You’re not lonely?
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy on skype.,Sheldon,"Oh, not at all. I’ve had outings with Leonard and Raj in the evening, and, oh, I had lunch"

Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy on skype.,Sheldon,"Many years ago. Back when she was a grad student. She’s always been a huge fan of my work, and now she’s doing research at Caltech."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy on skype.,Amy,"Huge fan, you say?"
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy on skype.,Sheldon,"Yes. I think you’d like her. She’s extremely intelligent, just like you. Unlike you, she’s tall, blonde and used to be an Olympic swimmer."

Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Penny(answering skype),"Oh, hey, Amy."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Amy,I gave you one job. Keep an eye on him. How hard is that?
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Penny,We thought you meant not letting him run out into traffic.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Bernadette,Which he only did once.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Amy,Why didn’t you tell me?
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Bernadette,We didn’t want you to worry.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Amy,Should I worry?
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Penny,"No. Come on, it’s Sheldon. Nothing is gonna happen."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Amy,"That’s what you said to me when I started dating him. And then five years later, bingo bango, something happened."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Bernadette,"Yeah, but you’re gonna be back in three months."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Amy,You don’t get it. I’ve been smacking that ketchup bottle for a long time. All she’s got to do is tip it over and point it at her fries.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Penny,"Well, what do you want us to do?"
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Amy,"I don’t know. Might be the New Jersey talking, but this Nowitzki broad needs to disappear."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Bernadette,"That’s ridiculous. As far as we know, all that happened is two scientists had lunch."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Amy,"Yeah, but one of those scientists is a tall, blonde Olympic swimmer."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Penny,Come on. Looks don’t matter to Sheldon. Because he only has eyes for you.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Amy,Nice try.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Penny,Thanks. I was scrambling.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The comic book store.,Howard,It’s unbelievable. Sheldon has lunch with another woman and somehow my wife yells at me.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The comic book store.,Leonard,"Penny laid into me, too. Apparently, I’m overly fixated on premium Swiss chocolate bars."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The comic book store.,Raj,Can you even eat those things?
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The comic book store.,Leonard,If I take a Lactaid a half-hour before and some Pepto right after.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The comic book store.,Raj,Sounds like a lot of work.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The comic book store.,Leonard,"Eh, I’m worth it."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The comic book store.,Howard,Guys. Focus. Should we do something about Nowitzki?
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The comic book store.,Leonard,Like what?
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The comic book store.,Raj,"Uh, well, she’s single, so if somebody else asks her out and she says yes, then we know she’s not into Sheldon."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The comic book store.,Stuart,I’ll do it.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The comic book store.,Leonard,"No offence, Stuart, but the woman’s a doctor."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The comic book store.,Stuart,So? Doctors like me. Whenever I see mine he calls in a bunch of other doctors to have a look.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The comic book store.,Howard,She’s not that kind of doctor.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The comic book store.,Stuart,"Oh. Well, her loss. I’ve been called a genuine medical oddity."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The comic book store.,Raj,"Actually, I was going to suggest me."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The comic book store.,Howard,"Great. Anybody’s better than, mmm."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The comic book store.,Stuart,"Excuse me. They took out my spleen and gallbladder, not my feelings."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The cafeteria.,Raj,Dr. Nowitzki. Good to see you.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The cafeteria.,Ramona,"Good to see you, too."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The cafeteria.,Raj,May I join you?
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The cafeteria.,Ramona,No.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The cafeteria.,Raj,Good to see you.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The cafeteria.,Howard,"We should call Guinness, that might be a record."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The cafeteria.,Raj,She’s clearly having a working lunch and preferred to eat alone.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The cafeteria.,Ramona,"Dr. Cooper, over here."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The cafeteria.,Raj,I could have made her very happy.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The cafeteria.,Leonard,You kept walking. I think you did.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Penny,Do you really think there’s reason to worry?
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Leonard,"Yeah, she’s definitely going after Sheldon."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Raj,I made a play for her and she shot me down.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Penny,"All right, well, that doesn’t prove anything."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Bernadette,"Yeah, there’s a million reasons a woman would shoot Raj down."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Raj,"Like, really, a million?"
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Bernadette,"Fine, hundreds."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Raj,Thank you.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Penny,The point is this could be nothing and we are all overreacting.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Hey, everybody. This is my friend, Dr. Nowitzki."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Ramona,Hi.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,,All; Hi.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Sheldon,We just went swimming.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,"The same, later.",Leonard,And you actually got in a pool?
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,"The same, later.",Sheldon,"I was scared, but I told myself it’s just a big bathtub. Then I got scared again ’cause there are all these strangers in my bathtub."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,"The same, later.",Ramona,"I was proud of him, a lot of people don’t put their face in the water on the first day."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,"The same, later.",Sheldon,"Well, I was hiding from a bee, but it still counts."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,"The same, later.",Bernadette,Can I just squeeze in here?
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,"The same, later.",Penny,"So, Sheldon, have you talked to Amy?"
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,"The same, later.",Sheldon,"Yes, we skyped this morning and I’m sure I’ll check in with her before I go to sleep."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,"The same, later.",Ramona,Sheldon talks about her all the time. I can’t wait to meet her.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,"The same, later.",Sheldon,That is true. She keeps asking how long Amy’s going to be gone.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,"The same, later.",Leonard,"Uh, so, Ramona, tell us about yourself. Do you, do you have a boyfriend?"
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,"The same, later.",Sheldon,"Leonard, your wife is sitting right here. What are you doing?"
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,"The same, later.",Ramona,"No, my work doesn’t leave me a lot of time for relationships."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,"The same, later.",Raj,I think you made that very clear.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,"The same, later.",Sheldon,She was part of the American team at CERN.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,"The same, later.",Ramona,I had a front row seat when they detected the Higgs boson.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,"The same, later.",Sheldon,"Do you know, I’ve corresponded with Peter Higgs. Would you like to see some of his letters?"
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,"The same, later.",Ramona,Absolutely.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,"The same, later.",Sheldon,I’ll get them.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,"The same, later.",Ramona,"Well, hang on, I’ll come with you."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,"The same, later.",Sheldon,"Oh, fun. Like a play date."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,"The same, later.",Penny,"Okay, correct me if I’m wrong, but isn’t that exactly what we were supposed to stop from happening?"
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,"The same, later.",Bernadette,"I threw my body at them, what else did you want me to do?"
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,"The same, later.",Leonard,You think you should call Amy?
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,"The same, later.",Penny,"You got fingers and a mouth, you call her."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,Here you go.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Ramona,Are these all from Peter Higgs?
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Hmm? Oh, no, no, no. They’re from many famous people. See? Oh, like this one. This is from Patrick Stewart. It says if I come to his house again, I get to meet his dogs. Oh, excuse me."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Hello, Sheldon."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Oh, hello, Amy."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,I was missing you again.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"I miss you, too. Hey, this is good timing. Remember that Dr. Nowitzki I told you about? She’s right here."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,She’s what?
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Ramona,Hello.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,Hi.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Ramona,So nice to meet you.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,"Uh-huh. Hang on.(answering phone)Hello. A little late, Leonard. Sorry."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,What is Leonard doing calling you at this hour?
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Amy,It’s not important.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"I must tell you, that seems a little inappropriate. Don’t you agree?"
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Ramona,I do.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,See? We both think so.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Penny,"All right, this is making me crazy. Somebody’s got to go over there."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Leonard,"You got feet and legs, you do it."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Penny,Will you go with me?
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Bernadette,To do what? Shake a can of nickels at them?
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Raj,We’re being ridiculous. There’s no way a woman that attractive is trying to seduce Sheldon Cooper.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Howard,You done trying to make yourself feel better?
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Raj,No. I haven’t played the race card yet.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Sheldon,"Hey, I hate to break up the party, but Amy says I’m tired and have to go to bed."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Ramona,It was nice seeing everybody. Thank you for dinner.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Penny,Sure.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Leonard,Our pleasure.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Raj,Whatever.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Ramona,Walk me to my car?
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Sheldon,Of course.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Penny,We’ll all go.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Bernadette,Excuse me.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Penny,"Pardon. I just need to., yeah."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The apartment.,Sheldon,That was fun. It was like Mario Kart.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The street.,Sheldon,Bye.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The street.,Penny,We need to talk.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,The street.,Sheldon,What? Is this about Leonard and Amy? I don’t like it either.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Penny,"Okay, I know you don’t have a lot of experience with women, but Ramona seems to have a romantic interest in you."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,That doesn’t make any sense. She knows I have a girlfriend.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Penny,"Well, sometimes women don’t care. Sometimes it makes them want a guy even more."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"That may be true, but Dr. Nowitzki’s just a friend. In fact, I wouldn’t have even noticed she’s a woman if she hadn’t worn that bathing suit that highlighted her bosom."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Penny,"Okay. Um, let’s try this. Think of yourself as one of those limited edition toys people like to collect."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,I already do.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Penny,"Well, then you get it."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Because there’s only one of me, I’m more valuable."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Penny,Right.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Although, Amy’s already taken me out of my package and played with me."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Penny,"Let’s forget the toy thing, okay? Um, maybe…"
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,"Penny, look. I appreciate your concern, but I don’t think that’s what’s happening."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Penny,All right. What do you think is happening?
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Sheldon,I think Dr. Nowitzki is a friendly colleague. I think you and Leonard need to see a marriage counsellor. And I need to update my résumé to include swimming as a special skill.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon and Amy’s apartment.,Penny,"Don’t look at me like that, I tried."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon’s office.,Ramona,"Hey, did you eat yet?"
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon’s office.,Sheldon,"Uh, breakfast yes, lunch no. I did have a cough drop, but that really rides the line between sucking and eating."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon’s office.,Ramona,"Well, perfect. I made us sandwiches."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon’s office.,Sheldon,How thoughtful. Thank you.
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon’s office.,Ramona,"Mmm. No big deal, I enjoy spending time with you."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon’s office.,Sheldon,"And I with you. Question, are you seeking a romantic relationship with me?"
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon’s office.,Ramona,What if I were?
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Sheldon’s office.,Sheldon,"Well, that would raise a number of problems. We’re colleagues. I’m currently in a relation… Excuse me a moment."
Series 10,Episode 24,The Long Distance Dissonance,Princeton.,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock)Amy.(Knock, knock, knock)Amy.(Knock, knock, knock)Amy. Will you marry me?"
