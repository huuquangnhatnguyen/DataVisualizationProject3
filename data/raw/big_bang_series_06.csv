" Uh-huh. Well, the holographic principle suggests that what we all experience every day in three dimensions may really (changes view to solar system) just be information (changes view to the galaxy) on a surface located at the farthest reaches of our cosmos. (Starts the galaxy spinning) So it’s possible that our lives are really just acting out a painting on the largest canvas in the universe.",Leonard,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation
 What do you mean? (Leonard flicks a switch. The hologram changes to a view of the planet Earth). Oh! Wow!,Penny,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation
" You know, there’s a foundational idea in string theory that the whole universe may be a hologram.",Leonard,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation
 Wow. That is amazing.,Penny,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation
" Very good. And then a laser will map the reflective surface, and voila. (A floating 3D image of the pencil appears. Leonard moves it around with his finger)",Leonard,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation
 Sharp. Thanks to the machine we saw earlier.,Penny,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation
" Yeah. It’s a front-projected holographic display combined with laser-based finger tracking. Here, I’ll show you. We’ll just put this pencil over here.",Leonard,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation
 Yeah?,Penny,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation
 It’s actually pretty neat.,Leonard,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation
" Ooh, low-techie-techie. So, what are you working on right now?",Penny,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation
 That is a pencil sharpener.,Leonard,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation
 What are you smiling at?,Sheldon,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation
" Hello, boys.",Leonard,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation
" That reminds me, I was thinking about wearing my NASA jumpsuit as a costume. But then I realized everyone would be, like, where’s your costume? Why are you wearing your work clothes, you nut?",Howard,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation
" Ooh, Hallow-weenies! That’s a good one. They’ll pair nicely with my Draculoni and Cheese. How do I do it?",Raj,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation
" I’m sorry, but these are just ordinary foods with the names bent into tortured puns. The dishes themselves are in no way Halloweenie.",Sheldon,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation

 Really? Never?,Penny,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation
" No, no. It’s kind of crazy. I’ve never fooled around in the lab before.",Leonard,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation
 Yeah. You got a problem with that?,Penny,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation
 What? Here? Now?,Leonard,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation
 Of course you can. But maybe a good rule would be to wait for people to bring it up.,Bernadette,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation
" So, I did this amazing thing and I’m never allowed to mention it?",Howard,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation
" I’m just saying, people are getting a little tired of it.",Bernadette,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation
 What was I supposed to talk about? We were eating at Johnny Rockets.,Howard,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation
 Tonight at dinner you went on bout it for an hour straight.,Bernadette,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation
 I don’t talk about it every minute.,Howard,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation

 What?,Howard,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation
" Okay, we need to talk.",Bernadette,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation

" Yeah, you mentioned it once or twice.",Bernadette,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation

 A grad student forgot to take out one of his piercings. Now he’s on a transplant list waiting for a nipple his size. Now watch this.,Leonard,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation

" Yeah. Oh, uh, you don’t have on any jewellery, do you?",Leonard,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation
 Whoa! That’s heavy.,Penny,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation

 I don’t care. Get the Tardis.,Howard,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation
 Do you have a preference?,Raj,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation
" A Tardis makes no sense. It’s a time machine from a science-fiction show. It has nothing to do with Halloween. That being said, if you don’t get a Tardis, you stink and your party stinks.",Sheldon,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation
 What are you talking about? It’ll be fun. All your friends’ll be there.,Bernadette,6.0,5.0,The Holographic Excitation

" All right, I’ve had enough of this. I’m a grown man, I have a successful career, for the love of God, I’ve been to space. I will move out when I’m ready, and I don’t need anyone badgering me into it.",Howard,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" Because your friend was rude to her, and then you went to dinner with him.",Leonard,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
 You’re just repeating what I said. It’s like living with a lactose-intolerant parrot.,Sheldon,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" Trust me, call her.",Leonard,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" Fine. It’s a shame you didn’t go to dinner with us, because the buffet you’re about to enjoy only serves humble pie, a dessert much less tasty than frozen yoghurt. I was this close.",Sheldon,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
 What?,skype),6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" You’ll appreciate this. Leonard has some ridiculous notion that you’re mad at me. Tell him you’re not mad at me. Go ahead, set him straight.",Sheldon,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" I’m mad at you, Sheldon.",Amy,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" Hmm. Eat one of your Luna bars. Very often when women think they’re angry, they’re really just hungry.",Sheldon,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" I’m not hungry. Your friend insulted me, and you didn’t do anything.",Amy,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" Precisely, I didn’t do anything. Now does someone feel like checking her emotional math?",Sheldon,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" Keep going, buddy, you’re doing great.",Leonard,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" Sheldon, I’m your girlfriend, and you should have taken my side. That’s it. End of story. Good night.",Amy,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" Wow, Amy’s mad and Leonard was right. What a weird day.",Sheldon,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" Oh, yeah. Fifth grade. Sixth grade. Seventh grade. Eighth grade. Ninth grade.",Leonard,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" I remember when I was five, hiding under this desk with all my Halloween candy. Had some Peanut M&M’S, went into my first anaphylactic shock and had to be rushed to the hospital. Came home, celebrated with a Snickers, went into my second anaphylactic shock.",Howard,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
 When did you figure out you were allergic to nuts?,Raj,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" No, I’m a terrible waitress, remember?",Penny,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" So, is there anything I can do to help you with the move tomorrow?",Bernadette,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" Now that you mention it, I was thinking tomorrow might not be great.",Howard,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
 What’s your excuse this time?,Bernadette,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" No excuse. It’s just, you know, I’m Jewish, and technically, we’re not supposed to drive or carry anything on the Sabbath. So this one’s on God.",Howard,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
 That might be a little more convincing if you didn’t have a mouthful of bacon cheeseburger.,Bernadette,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" My religion’s kinda loosey-goosey. Basically, as long as you got your schmekel clipped and don’t wear a cross, you’re good.",Howard,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" Howie, you promised you’d move.",Bernadette,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
 And I will.,Howard,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" Yeah, right.",Penny,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
 I will. I’m obviously not going to live in my mother’s house for the rest of my life. I’m not a child.,Howard,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
 I’ve seen her burp you.,Penny,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" She did not burp me. She was patting me on the back, and I happened to burp. Don’t you have other tables you should be waiting on?",Howard,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
 Will that calm my nerves?,Sheldon,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
 It’s calmed the pants off me a couple of times.,Penny,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
 Sold.,Sheldon,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" Wow, excuse me.",Penny,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration

 Star Trek DVDs? Why would I want this?,Amy,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" First of all, you’re welcome. And furthermore, not being familiar with Wil Wheaton’s body of work, there was no way for you to know you were being rude to a national treasure. Get ready for 130 hours of I told you so. (She hands him back the DVDs and slams the door) Fine. I’ll just tell you what happens. Episode one, Encounter at Farpoint. Fade in. The new Enterprise heads out on its maiden voyage to contact the Bandi people of Deneb IV.

" They’d say, why does he touch himself so much?",Leonard,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
 Yeah. I can’t believe I’m not going to live here anymore. This has always been my bedroom. Right here is where my mom used to mark my height.,Howard,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" On the other hand, that low-down polecat done wronged my woman.",Sheldon,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" Welcome to Long Island, Tex.",Penny,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" Amy deserves better. You know, when we buy the Planter’s deluxe mix, she eats all the Brazil nuts so I don’t have to look at them. She’s a unique blend of saint and squirrel.",Sheldon,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
 Sometime around the third Almond Joy.,Howard,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
 Okay. You want to start loading this stuff into the truck?,Leonard,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration

" Penny, if you wouldn’t mind, I’d like to have a conversation about girls.",Sheldon,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
 I had a feeling we’d have a talk like this sooner or later. Are you finally getting fuzz in weird places?,Penny,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" Penny, please, I’m on the horns of a relationship dilemma. And for the record, I had a full pubis of hair by the time I was 19.",Sheldon,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration

 You could have a Long Island Iced Tea.,Penny,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" You know, she’s why I first got into magic. I would do little shows for her, hang up a bedsheet like it was a curtain, put on a top hat and cape. And part way through the act, I would say I needed a volunteer from the audience to be my beautiful assistant and invite her up on stage. I can still remember the way she’d smile. For a few minutes, she’d forget how lonely she was.",Howard,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" Aw, crap. Let’s go.",Bernadette,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration

" Oh. So, the heart you got from the wizard giving you trouble?",Penny,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" The trouble isn’t with me, Penny, it’s with your gender. Someday, scientists will discover that second X chromosome contains nothing but nonsense and twaddle.",Sheldon,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" Yeah, Amy told me what happened. Look, just apologize. It’ll warm her twaddle.",Penny,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" It’s a Band-Aid at best. See, the core problem is that Amy and Wil do not like each other. Which is baffling because they’re both crazy about me. And I like them, which indicates they’re bright and interesting and/or were on Star Trek.",Sheldon,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" Honey, you can’t make people like each other.",Penny,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" Not true. Leonard made me like you. And let me tell you, that was a hard row to hoe. Cheers, pal. Ooh. Boy, that is a treat that’s hard to beat. Get the Mad Hatter on the horn, I’m having a tea party.",Sheldon,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
 You might want to pace yourself.,Penny,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
 I drink tea all the time. I think I know what I’m doing.,Sheldon,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" Far be it from me to criticize a man with a full pubis. Look, Sheldon, your problem is not Wil Wheaton, okay? Your problem is the way you treated Amy.",Penny,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
 My problem is I’m out of tea.,Sheldon,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" Come on, someone insulted your girlfriend and you just let him do it. I thought you Texas guys stood up for your womenfolk.",Penny,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration

 Sorry.,Penny,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" Yeah, actually, a little more would be helpful.",Wil,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration

 That’s a lot for a kid to deal with.,Bernadette,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
" She was just so sad all the time. I was the only person who could cheer her up. Well, me and Ben and Jerry.",Howard,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
 She’s lucky you were there.,Bernadette,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration
 Grab a box. We’ll sleep at your mother’s place tonight.,Bernadette,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration

 Wouldn’t you like to know?,Sheldon,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration

 Are you okay?,Wil,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration

" I don’t care for your friend, he’s being rude to me. You need to ask him to leave.",Amy,6.0,7.0,The Habitation Configuration

 But what are you doing in there?,Howard,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
" Sorry? You may not realize it, but I have difficulty navigating certain aspects of daily life. You know, understanding sarcasm, feigning interest in others, not talking about trains as much as I want to. It’s exhausting. Which is why, for twenty minutes a day, I like to go down to that room, turn my mind off and do what I need to do to recharge.",Sheldon,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity

 I’m talking about important things like emotional maturity.,Leonard,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
" Not height, vision, athleticism, or ability to digest dairy products.",Sheldon,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
" Well, yeah, but this isn’t just about looks. I’m, I’m way above average in a lot of other things.",Leonard,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
" No, you didn’t.",Howard,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
 I just told you.,Sheldon,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
 We just told you.,Raj,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
 Where are you going?,Sheldon,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
 You think you don’t care?,Sheldon,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
" It’s not a big deal. He’s just in her history class. They’re working on a project together. I don’t even know why I care. You know what, I don’t care.",Leonard,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
" To be honest, I didn’t know you were here.",Sheldon,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity

" Howard, please, you can’t treat the man differently just because he’s disabled. That’s not okay.",Raj,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
 Why would he chain up Stephen Hawking?,Howard,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
 He is kind of a weirdo. Maybe he’s got Leonard Nimoy chained up in there. Or Bill Gates. Or Stephen Hawking.,Raj,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
 What the hell is he up to?,Howard,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
 Thank you.,Howard,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity

" Fine, I’ll be a ninja, you be a cat burglar.",Howard,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
 Not yet. What are you doing?,Howard,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
" Well, he’s not doing twenty-minute abs, because if he were, he would have way better abs. Can you hear anything?",Raj,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
 What could he be doing in there every day for twenty minutes?,Howard,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
 I think it’s an old storage room.,Raj,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity

 Now you’re just being ridiculous.,Leonard,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
" While unlikely, it’s still a statistical possibility. She might be performing sexual acts with him and not even know it.",Sheldon,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
 What?,Leonard,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
" Well, unless of course he’s a skilled hypnotist.",Sheldon,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
" None of this matters. I trust that Penny cares about me, and nothing’s gonna happen with this guy.",Leonard,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
" I’m not saying you don’t have attractive qualities. Your choice of friends is impeccable, you’re a good sleeper, and last but not least, you buy the grapes I like. You’re a real catch compared to some snoring guy with a fridge full of lousy grapes.",Sheldon,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
 I liked it better when you thought I wasn’t here.,Leonard,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
 You were just spying on your girlfriend through a peephole.,Sheldon,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
" Don’t worry, I’m one step ahead of him.",Howard,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
 What if it’s booby-trapped?,Raj,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
" Yeah, so?",Howard,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
" Well, if we assume your looks are average, yeah, right off the bat, fifty percent of men on Earth are more attractive than you. That’s one point five billion handsome lads standing by, waiting to rain on your parade.",Sheldon,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
 What do you mean?,Leonard,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
" Oh, I don’t know. I mean, statistically speaking, I’m sure you have something to worry about.",Sheldon,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
 This is silly. I have nothing to worry about.,Leonard,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
 How did that work out?,Raj,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity

" I don’t want to be a ninja, I want to be a cat burglar.",Raj,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
 I think we’re more like ninjas.,Howard,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
" Look at us, sneaking around in the middle of the night like a couple of cat burglars.",Raj,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity

 He’s always been very cagey about what he puts in his egg salad to make it so tasty.,Raj,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
 What kind of secret does Sheldon have to encrypt?,Howard,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
 Maybe. It’s a prime number. Encryption systems are built on prime numbers.,Raj,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
 I don’t know. The solution to an equation?,Howard,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
 Yeah. Huh. Forty-three? What the hell does that mean?,Raj,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
 Are we good?,Howard,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
" Great, what’s your pl… (Howard pushes him inside)",Raj,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity

" Oh, hello, Dr. Hofstadter.",Alex,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity

 What?,Howard,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
" Hold on, hold on.",Raj,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity

 That’s the name of his gang. The Scientists. They are crazy.,Leonard,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
" I’m sorry. We can’t all eat whatever we want and still stay thin. Wait, in the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, isn’t forty-three the answer to the question of life, the universe,and everything?",Raj,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity
 Why would you know that?,Howard,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity

" I don’t know. It-it-it’s hard sometimes. Everywhere you go, guys hit on you, even if I’m standing right there. And they’re all taller than me. Why is everyone taller than me? You know what, this is all in my head. It’s my problem, not yours.",Leonard,6.0,8.0,The 43 Peculiarity

May I remind you that you’re the president of a major university, not the president of the Potty Mouth Club. There it is again. Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?

" I don’t want another parking space. I want my parking space. It’s perfect. It’s a corner spot, cutting the risk of door-dings in half. It’s a mere 28 steps from the building entrance.

" Oh, I’m hanging in there. Thanks for asking.",Sheldon,6.0,10.0,The Fish Guts Displacement
" Okay, Amy, I brought you some drugs we were working on in the lab. This is proving really good for congestion, but there’s a slight chance it can make your tears burn like acid, so if you take it, happy thoughts.",Bernadette,6.0,10.0,The Fish Guts Displacement
" Uh, I’m going to draw you a soothing bath. Where’s your bath thermometer?",Sheldon,6.0,10.0,The Fish Guts Displacement
 I don’t have a bath thermometer.,Amy,6.0,10.0,The Fish Guts Displacement
 Fine. Then I’m going to draw you a nerve-wracking bath of indeterminate temperature.,Sheldon,6.0,10.0,The Fish Guts Displacement
 This is a really good expectorant. Although some test subjects reported lactating uncontrollably when they heard music.,Bernadette,6.0,10.0,The Fish Guts Displacement

 I could not be allowed to go to the opening of the next Star Trek movie.,Amy,6.0,10.0,The Fish Guts Displacement
" Oh, that seems overly harsh. I mean, you gave in to a human weakness, you didn’t kill a man. You know, it’s a tad old-school, but my father was not one to spare the rod when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey.",Sheldon,6.0,10.0,The Fish Guts Displacement
 Are you saying you want to spank me?,Amy,6.0,10.0,The Fish Guts Displacement

" No, I’m fine. Keep going.",Howard,6.0,10.0,The Fish Guts Displacement

 It’s not our fault. Our dads never did anything like this with us.,Leonard,6.0,10.0,The Fish Guts Displacement
" What, never?",Penny,6.0,10.0,The Fish Guts Displacement
" My dad was an anthropologist. The only father-son time he spent was with a 2,000-year-old skeleton of an Etruscan boy. I hated that kid.",Leonard,6.0,10.0,The Fish Guts Displacement
" Mine just took me to his gynecology office. I got so bored, I’d put vaginal lubricant on the bottom of my shoes and pretend I was ice-skating.",Raj,6.0,10.0,The Fish Guts Displacement
" Yeah, well, my quality father-son time was spending my adolescence looking out the window waiting for my dad to come back someday.",Howard,6.0,10.0,The Fish Guts Displacement
" So, why’d you agree to come?",Rostenkowski,6.0,10.0,The Fish Guts Displacement
 ‘Cause Bernadette made me.,Howard,6.0,10.0,The Fish Guts Displacement

" Oh, Sheldon, am I glad you’re back. Taking a turn for the worst. I think I’m going to need another bath.",Amy,6.0,10.0,The Fish Guts Displacement
" I’m surprised to hear that. See, the other day, I was concerned that you weren’t recovering, so while you were sleeping, I took a cheek swab and had it cultured in the lab.",Sheldon,6.0,10.0,The Fish Guts Displacement
 Oh?,Amy,6.0,10.0,The Fish Guts Displacement
" I got the results back. Have you developed any of the following symptoms? A growing nose, or perhaps a warm sensation in the trouser region? Also known as full-blown liar, liar, pants on fire.",Sheldon,6.0,10.0,The Fish Guts Displacement
" All right, all right. But I really was sick at the beginning. It’s just been so nice having you take care of me.",Amy,6.0,10.0,The Fish Guts Displacement
" It hurts that you would lie to me, Amy. I thought our relationship was based on trust and a mutual admiration that skews in my favour.",Sheldon,6.0,10.0,The Fish Guts Displacement
 I feel terrible I did this.,Amy,6.0,10.0,The Fish Guts Displacement
" It pains me to say it, but I think some form of penalty is in order, so as to discourage this type of behaviour in the future.",Sheldon,6.0,10.0,The Fish Guts Displacement
 I suppose that’s fair. What do you suggest?,Amy,6.0,10.0,The Fish Guts Displacement
 Are you prepared to receive your punishment?,Sheldon,6.0,10.0,The Fish Guts Displacement
 One second. I want to put on some music.,Amy,6.0,10.0,The Fish Guts Displacement
 Why?,Sheldon,6.0,10.0,The Fish Guts Displacement

 No good? The guy at the sporting goods store said these are what fishermen wear.,Howard,6.0,10.0,The Fish Guts Displacement
 Maybe in cartoons.,Rostenkowski,6.0,10.0,The Fish Guts Displacement

" Well, uh, there was a time when I had a thing for Penny, and I thought she was into me, too, because she got drunk and naked and climbed into bed with me. But apparently I misread those signals.",Raj,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Seven, six.",Leonard,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Wait, wait. Svaty Vaclav is better known as Good King Wenceslas from the beloved Victorian Christmas carol.",Sheldon,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 Never heard of it. Must be the one Christmas song not written by a Jewish guy.,Howard,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Three, two.",Leonard,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 Somebody sing the damn song.,Stuart,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Good King Wenceslas looked out, on the feast of Stephen. When the snow lay ’round about, deep and crisp and even",Sheldon,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 The walls are getting slower.,Leonard,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Nope. I guess the heart wants what the heart wants. Or in this case, doesn’t, I mean, at all. What?",Raj,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 The apartment. Sheldon is still singing.,Scene,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Ye who now will bless the poor, shall yourselves find blessing. Ba-da-bum.",Sheldon,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 Done?,Howard,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 I think the word you’re looking for is bravo.,Sheldon,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Okay, you leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen.",Leonard,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 Melted snowmen? Are there carrots and lumps of coal in the water?,Sheldon,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 I don’t know. What’s the difference?,Leonard,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Well it’s a game of the imagination, Leonard. Paint a picture.",Sheldon,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Of course he is. Look, that girl just got dumped by her boyfriend. She’s angry, she’s drunk, and her favorite movie is Slumdog Millionaire. I mean.",Penny,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 That is some low-hanging fruit.,Amy,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Oh, here he comes.",Bernadette,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" So, how’d it go?",Penny,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Great. I bought her a couple of drinks, and she gave me her e-mail address.",Raj,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 Ooh!,Penny,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 Jennifer at not-even-if-you-were-the-last-guy-on-earth dot loser.,Bernadette,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Yes. What, is there a problem?",Sheldon,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" No, it’s nice to see you enjoying a holiday beverage. Pretty Christmassy.",Leonard,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 Since when is eggnog a Christmas drink? Eggs are available all year ’round. I’ve been known to enjoy this poolside.,Sheldon,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Come on, Sheldon. You know all the Christmas stories, and the carols, you’ve got an eggnog moustache going on there. Just admit it. You’re getting a little Yuletide spirit.",Leonard,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Oh, don’t be silly. Christmas is a bunch of baloney created by the tinsel industry. Why is this so important to you?",Sheldon,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Honestly, because I had enough crappy Christmases as a kid and I’m tired of you sucking the joy out of them now.",Leonard,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 What was so bad about them?,Stuart,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" I grew up in a house full of crazy academics. Instead of leaving Santa milk and cookies, we had to leave him a research paper. And in the morning, you could tell he’d been there because the paper would be graded.",Leonard,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 No wonder you love Christmas. That sounds amazing.,Sheldon,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 And you liked Bernadette also?,Amy,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 That was before Penny. I make it a rule to only fall for one of my friends’ girlfriends at a time. I’m very old-fashioned that way.,Raj,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" So at, uh, some point, you probably had a thing for me, too.",Amy,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" No, not really.",Raj,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Oh, come on, Raj, not even a little bit?",Penny,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 Not that I can think of.,Raj,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 Think harder.,Bernadette,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" I understand. In seventh grade, I played Spin the Bottle and it landed on Alina Shankar. She said if I came near her, she would break the bottle and cut me.",Raj,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" You think that’s bad? In college, I passed out at a frat party and woke up with more clothes on.",Amy,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Sometimes I get so lonely, I sit on my left hand until it goes numb, then I put it in my right hand and pretend I’m holding hands with another person.",Raj,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" I do that, too. Sometimes the left hand tries to cop a feel. And I let it.",Amy,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 It’s kind of nice to talk to someone who understands what it feels like to be alone.,Raj,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" It is, isn’t it?",Amy,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 But you’re not alone anymore. Now you’ve got Sheldon.,Raj,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" I do. And don’t worry, someday you’ll have somebody, too.",Amy,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 Thank you. I hope she’s half as lovely and amazing as you are.,Raj,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 Fine. You leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen. There are carrots and lumps of coal in the water.,Leonard,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 What happened to the top hats and the corncob pipes?,Sheldon,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" You see those, too.",Leonard,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Oh, it’s like I’m really there.",Sheldon,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" I gotta tell you, this, this is the most holiday fun I’ve had since my therapist changed my anxiety medication and I stopped caring about the blood in my stool.",Stuart,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 Good story.,Howard,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 What are you drinking there? A little eggnog?,Leonard,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 The drawbridge is lowering.,Leonard,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 My carpal tunnel’s acting up.,Stuart,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 Play through the pain.,Sheldon,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" You did it. The drawbridge is down. You cross the chasm and find yourself in a small dungeon room. And in the corner, chained to the wall, you see a bloodied and beaten Santa Claus. He says, ho, ho, help me.",Leonard,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Yes, we found Santa. Christmas is saved. Don’t ever tell my mother I said that.",Howard,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 I take out my skeleton key and run to Santa to unchain him.,Stuart,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" But first, I cast a spell of paralysis on Stuart and Howard.",Sheldon,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Wait, what are you doing?",Howard,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" You can’t talk, you’re paralyzed. I get right up in Santa’s big, fat face and say, well, well, well, jolly old Saint Nick, we meet again. Yeah, I believe the last time we spoke was in the Baybrook Mall in Galveston, Texas, when I was five years old, isn’t that right?",Sheldon,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 It wasn’t amazing. I got a C-minus four years in a row.,Leonard,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Yeah, I’m familiar with your work. C-minus was your gift.",Sheldon,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 The bar.,Scene,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Amy, I’m really sorry. I didn’t mean to upset you.",Raj,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" It’s fine. I’m used to being the girl who never gets looked at twice. I didn’t have my first kiss till I was 22, and the guy only did it so I’d give him back his insulin.",Amy,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 Sometimes the pancreas wants what the pancreas wants.,Bernadette,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 Forget it. I don’t expect you guys to understand.,Amy,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Oh, hello, Sheldon. You should be asleep.",Santa,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Well, then, you shouldn’t have jingle bells on your boots.",Sheldon,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Oh. I’ve been wanting to talk to you. I’m sorry I disappointed you when you were a little boy. I can do a lot of magical things, but unfortunately bringing your Pop-Pop back isn’t one of them.",Santa,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 I understand.,Sheldon,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 But I do have something special for you. Close your eyes.,Santa,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Oh, I hope it’s a train.",Sheldon,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Oh, it’s better than a train.",Santa,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 Two trains?,Sheldon,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 Better.,Santa,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Thank you, Rajesh. He wants me, I’m good. We can go now.",Amy,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 Damn it.,Raj,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 What?,Penny,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Now that I know she doesn’t like me, I’m kind of into her.",Raj,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 The apartment. Sheldon is writing numbers on a whiteboard.,Scene,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 All right. I think I cracked the code to lower the drawbridge.,Sheldon,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 Great. Let’s do it. (They pick up bells and play according to the numbers. The tune is Jingle Bells),Howard,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 Howard and Bernadette’s apartment. Bernadette is on the webcam.,Scene,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 Saturday night? But I’ve been working late all week. That was gonna be our night.,Bernadette,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" But I have to go. We play as a group. If-if I’m not there, then everyone will blame you. They’ll be all, Bernadette ruined everything. She’s the worst. So, you see? I have to play Dungeons and Dragons for the marriage.",Howard,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 You’re an idiot.,Bernadette,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Uh, okay.",Leonard,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" My mother dragged me there and she plopped me down on your lap and you asked me what I wanted for Christmas. And I told you, my Pop-Pop, because that was the year my grandfather died. I missed him and I wanted him back.",Sheldon,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" This is weird, right?",Leonard,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Pop-Pop was the only one in my family who encouraged me to pursue science. But you didn’t bring him back, did you? No, instead, I got Lincoln Logs. Well, you can build a lot of neat things out of Lincoln Logs, but Pop-Pop ain’t one of ’em. And now you’re here asking me for something, to save you. Well, sorry, Mr. Kringle, but today’s not your day. I’m leaving you here to rot, and I hope the ogres feast on your bones. I take the skeleton key, and I toss it into the chasm, and on the way out, I give Santa a swift kick in his bowl full of jelly!",Sheldon,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Okay. So Wolowitz and Stuart are paralyzed, Santa’s dead, and I picked this over having sex with my girlfriend.",Leonard,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation

" Oh, man, the first monster I see, I’m gonna sneak up behind him, whip out my wand, and shoot my magic all over his ass.",Raj,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 Do you hear yourself when you say these things?,Stuart,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Okay, there are ogre tracks and a trail of broken candy canes in the snow. Sheldon, what do you do?",Leonard,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 I signal my contempt for your cruel plan to shove Christmas joy down my throat by making a gesture that says get a load of this guy.,Sheldon,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Fine. Howard, what do you do?",Leonard,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 The apartment.,Scene,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation

 Why not?,Amy,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Amy, from time to time, we men need to break free from the shackles of civility and get in touch with our primal animalistic selves.",Sheldon,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
 By rolling dice and playing make-believe with little figurines?,Amy,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Yeah, like a bunch of savages.",Sheldon,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation

" Wait, doesn’t anyone have a rod of resurrection? Because if you’ve got one, I need it bad. Get in here with your rod and give it to me.",Raj,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Okay, you need to say these things in your head before you say them out loud.",Stuart,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation
" Hey, guys. I don’t mean to interrupt your little game, but I thought you’d like to see what you’re missing out on. So, Bernadette? Bernadette’s wearing leopard-print pumps and a rack-tastic red dress from Forever 21. And there’s Amy, showing all kinds of ankle. In an outfit I’m assuming is from Forever 63. And I, myself am wearing a little number that got me out of two speeding tickets and jury duty.",(entering),6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation

 Raj’s apartment.,Scene,6.0,11.0,The Santa Simulation

 Your assistant is totally hitting on this jerk and he loves it.,Raj,6.0,12.0,The Egg Salad Equivalency

 How could you do that to me? You know I’ve been working it with Alex for weeks.,Raj,6.0,12.0,The Egg Salad Equivalency
 Sheldon’s assistant asked me on a date last night.,Leonard,6.0,12.0,The Egg Salad Equivalency

 Terrific. Something weird happened and I don’t know what to do about it.,Leonard,6.0,12.0,The Egg Salad Equivalency

" Oh, please. Look at you with your pouty bee-stung lips.",Sheldon,6.0,12.0,The Egg Salad Equivalency
 I’m androgynous?,Leonard,6.0,12.0,The Egg Salad Equivalency

 I’m gonna kill her.,Penny,6.0,12.0,The Egg Salad Equivalency

 What is happening?,Penny,6.0,12.0,The Egg Salad Equivalency
" I want to thank you all for coming on such short notice.

 Mm-hmm. Anything else?,Penny,6.0,12.0,The Egg Salad Equivalency

 Hello.,Sheldon,6.0,12.0,The Egg Salad Equivalency
" Yeah, you and me both, sister. Now, please understand, I don’t hold you responsible for your behaviour because, see, from an evolutionary standpoint, you’re a slave to your desire to reproduce.

 What?,Alex,6.0,12.0,The Egg Salad Equivalency
" Now, there’s no need to get defensive. I’m not unsympathetic to your plight. My father used to say that a woman is like an egg salad sandwich on a warm Texas day.",Sheldon,6.0,12.0,The Egg Salad Equivalency
 What? I didn’t make a sexual advance on anybody.,Alex,6.0,12.0,The Egg Salad Equivalency
" You don’t know? Oh, you poor dear. Your ovaries are squirting so much goofy juice into your brains you don’t even know which way is up. You made an inappropriate sexual advance towards Dr. Hofstadter.",Sheldon,6.0,12.0,The Egg Salad Equivalency
" I needed advice about a woman. I would have asked you, but if the last few years have proven anything, it’s that you can’t tell a uterus from a unicycle.",Sheldon,6.0,12.0,The Egg Salad Equivalency
 Why would you do that?,Leonard,6.0,12.0,The Egg Salad Equivalency
" Oh, yes. Yeah, and a fat lot of good it did me. All she did was get mad at you.",Sheldon,6.0,12.0,The Egg Salad Equivalency
 I’m missing something. (Enters apartment. To Sheldon) Did you say something to Penny about Alex?,Leonard,6.0,12.0,The Egg Salad Equivalency

 Please forgive me. I should have told you about Alex.,Leonard,6.0,12.0,The Egg Salad Equivalency

 Mm. I found this quiz online called Which Star Trek Character Are You? and it only took me four tries to get Captain Kirk.,Leonard,6.0,12.0,The Egg Salad Equivalency
" Oh! I see the confusion here. No, no, Alex thought I was singling her out. No. I meant that all women are slaves to their biological urges, you know? Even you. You’re a slave.",Sheldon,6.0,12.0,The Egg Salad Equivalency
" Well, according to Ms. Jensen, you said that she was a slave to her biological urges and called her an egg salad sandwich. I don’t even know what that means, but I’m gonna go ahead and tell you you can’t say it.",Woman,6.0,12.0,The Egg Salad Equivalency
 Like what?,Sheldon,6.0,12.0,The Egg Salad Equivalency
" Cancel my next appointment. This is gonna take a while. Dr. Cooper, you said things to your employee that you just cannot say in the workplace.",Woman,6.0,12.0,The Egg Salad Equivalency
" So I’ve been told. But I can’t understand what she has to complain about. I mean, she has a front-row seat as I make scientific history.

 That’s great.,Leonard,6.0,12.0,The Egg Salad Equivalency

 What recordings?,Leonard,6.0,12.0,The Egg Salad Equivalency

" I’ve been working late every night. All I asked was that he clean the apartment and do one load of laundry. But did he do it? No. He just kept on playing that stupid game. You like pushing buttons so much, try pushing them on the washing machine.",Bernadette,6.0,16.0,The Tangible Affection Proof

 Nothing. Nothing.,Penny,6.0,16.0,The Tangible Affection Proof
 I don’t know how to respond to that.,Alex,6.0,16.0,The Tangible Affection Proof
" Well, I hope it’s with a third good option, because these first two, buh.",Sheldon,6.0,16.0,The Tangible Affection Proof
" Okay. Well, uh, luckily, I saved the best for last. Since Amy’s a neuroscientist, I did some research and found out that Santiago Ramon y Cajal, the father of modern neuroscience, did lots of hand drawings of brain cells. And I managed to find this signed print.",Alex,6.0,16.0,The Tangible Affection Proof
" Wow. Oh, this is truly remarkable.",Sheldon,6.0,16.0,The Tangible Affection Proof

" Hang on. As you know, I had planned a traditional evening of romance and gifts.",Amy,6.0,16.0,The Tangible Affection Proof
" Yes, and as you know, I planned to pretend to enjoy it. I’ve been working on this facial expression all day.",Sheldon,6.0,16.0,The Tangible Affection Proof
" And I appreciate your effort, but upon contemplation, I decided I was being selfish. So, I cancelled our dinner reservations and came up with an even better way to celebrate Valentine’s Day.",Amy,6.0,16.0,The Tangible Affection Proof
 What is that?,Sheldon,6.0,16.0,The Tangible Affection Proof
" By doing none of it. No dinner, no romance, no gifts. We stay here, order a pizza and watch one of your beloved Star War Trek things.",Amy,6.0,16.0,The Tangible Affection Proof
 They do look happy.,Bernadette,6.0,16.0,The Tangible Affection Proof
" Yeah, maybe tonight. But a year from now, he’ll be crawling under the sink looking for his Xbox. Well, he will.",Howard,6.0,16.0,The Tangible Affection Proof
 You know what? Why don’t we just forget about them and enjoy our Valentine’s Day?,Leonard,6.0,16.0,The Tangible Affection Proof
" Yes, absolutely. Now they’re doing that phony link-arm-drink thingy. I totally taught him that.",Penny,6.0,16.0,The Tangible Affection Proof

 I’m not saying that.,Leonard,6.0,16.0,The Tangible Affection Proof

" Fine, you win. You’re a bitch. Why couldn’t we just have a nice time?",Leonard,6.0,16.0,The Tangible Affection Proof
 I don’t know. Maybe ’cause things are going so well between us lately and I’ve been really happy.,Penny,6.0,16.0,The Tangible Affection Proof
" Okay, you’re gonna have to make a lot more sense than that.",Leonard,6.0,16.0,The Tangible Affection Proof
" Obviously, I have some commitment issues.",Penny,6.0,16.0,The Tangible Affection Proof
 Glaringly obvious. Go on.,Leonard,6.0,16.0,The Tangible Affection Proof
" As long as things keep going great between us, you’ll keep asking me to marry you, and eventually I’m gonna end up saying yes, and then we’re gonna be married forever, and the whole thing just freaks me out.",Penny,6.0,16.0,The Tangible Affection Proof
 Okay. I know I propose a lot. So how about this? I promise I will never ask you to marry me again.,Leonard,6.0,16.0,The Tangible Affection Proof
" What, what do you mean? Are you breaking up with me?",Penny,6.0,16.0,The Tangible Affection Proof
" No. No, no, no, no. But if someday you decide you want to get married, you have to propose to me.",Leonard,6.0,16.0,The Tangible Affection Proof
 Really?,Sheldon,6.0,16.0,The Tangible Affection Proof
" Well, that’s what you’d love, isn’t it?",Amy,6.0,16.0,The Tangible Affection Proof

Sheldon, I am not driving over there again. Because I drove over there yesterday for a brain tumour that turned out to be an ice cream headache. Yes, I still want to be your emergency contact. Yes, you can eat your ice cream too fast and also have a brain tumour. I’m on my way. Brain tumour would explain a lot.",Amy,6.0,16.0,The Tangible Affection Proof

 Right. And which one do I want?,Sheldon,6.0,17.0,The Monster Isolation

" Hello, I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. My apologies that this episode is coming late. I did shoot one last week, in honour of Black History Month, but I was informed by my roommate that my spot-on portrayal of George Washington Carver could be considered wildly racist. My heart goes out to the members of the African-American community, who, like me, have been kept down by The Man. Now, Fun with Flags is not just for the flag aficionado, it’s also for the flag novice, so, to help me with that, please welcome my friend, neighbour, and flag virgin, yeah, not a real virgin.

 Way to hit ’em with both barrels.,Leonard,6.0,20.0,The Tenure Turbulence

" Well, hang on. Maybe the Chinese haven’t finished watching it yet.",Penny,6.0,21.0,The Closure Alternative
" You know, if you’re trying to make space on the DVR, why don’t you just get rid of some of the stuff you’ve already watched? Like, um, Alphas.",Leonard,6.0,21.0,The Closure Alternative
" No, that’s the season two finale. That was quite the cliffhanger. I’m going to re-watch it before season three starts.",Sheldon,6.0,21.0,The Closure Alternative
 There is no season three. They cancelled that show.,Leonard,6.0,21.0,The Closure Alternative

" Oh, sure, what a wonderful idea. And after that, I’ll make up my own rules of oral hygiene. You know, instead of flossing, I’ll rub pudding on my gums. I’m going to get the number of the SyFy Channel and give them what for.",Sheldon,6.0,21.0,The Closure Alternative
" Oh, please, don’t do that.",Leonard,6.0,21.0,The Closure Alternative
 No. They can’t just cancel a show like Alphas. You know? They have to help the viewers let go. Firefly did a movie to wrap things up. Buffy the Vampire Slayer continued on as a comic book. Heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season till we were grateful it ended.,Sheldon,6.0,21.0,The Closure Alternative

" Yes, Mummy was right. American girls are sexually voracious devils.",Raj,6.0,21.0,The Closure Alternative

" With all the TV Sheldon was talking about, I had the greatest idea ever. It even blows away my idea for a Star Wars themed coffee shop called Brewbacca’s. You need to watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It is the perfect show for the two of us. It’s got action and jokes and hot vampires and romance. I cannot oversell this.

 It’s six thirty in the morning.,Penny,6.0,21.0,The Closure Alternative

 I am not flying back to Texas just so my mom can give me a hug.,Sheldon,6.0,21.0,The Closure Alternative
" Okay. Well, what I think is going on here is you have a pathological need for closure.",Amy,6.0,21.0,The Closure Alternative
" Oh, that’s nonsense. I mean, you tell me stories about your day all the time. I don’t care how they end.",Sheldon,6.0,21.0,The Closure Alternative

 So take what’s in that blog and use it to get her pants off.,Howard,6.0,21.0,The Closure Alternative
 Why do you have to make everything so filthy? Why couldn’t you just say the blog is like her giving me the key to her heart?,Raj,6.0,21.0,The Closure Alternative
 The key to her heart. That’s nice. Were you quoting someone or is it tattooed on the small of your back?,Howard,6.0,21.0,The Closure Alternative

 Yep. Your turn.,Amy,6.0,21.0,The Closure Alternative
" Oh, Amy. And you wonder why people think neuroscience is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies. Tic-tac-toe can only end in win, lose or draw, none of which will deny me closure.

 Exactly. How does that make you feel?,Amy,6.0,21.0,The Closure Alternative
 The same way any normal person would. I feel like I want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again and again until I have a handful of Sheldon-face confetti.,Sheldon,6.0,21.0,The Closure Alternative
 And that’s exactly the feeling we want to address with this course of treatment.,Amy,6.0,21.0,The Closure Alternative
" Or you could pitch in, grab a nostril and help me get this face off.",Sheldon,6.0,21.0,The Closure Alternative
" Come on, you can do this.",Amy,6.0,21.0,The Closure Alternative
 You don’t know what it’s like to feel completely frustrated. To have a desire build up within you and be denied any opportunity for release.,Sheldon,6.0,21.0,The Closure Alternative

" … but then it turns good again, and that means it’s better than if it had never been bad for a while. I know that now, thing’s aren’t good, they are in fact very very bad but at least my heart is starting to heal. Slowly but surely. And oh how I cried. It was like a little, uh, thunderstorm on my face. But I’m a man, okay? So I need to pull myself together, pick up a pen and get it all out in my journal. I mean, it’s not all bad, right? Having my heart broken has allowed me to finally speak in front of you, so, you know, a silver lining….",Raj,6.0,24.0,The Bon Voyage Reaction

 That’s great. Do you want some wine?,Penny,6.0,24.0,The Bon Voyage Reaction
" Uh, no, water’s fine. Anyhow, I’ve been thinking about it a lot and, and I totally see why Lucy did what she did. I pushed too hard. But you know what? If I back off and give her enough space, maybe there’s still a future for us. Yeah, the funny thing about life is that, you know, sometimes…",Raj,6.0,24.0,The Bon Voyage Reaction

 Did you bring enough inhalers?,Penny,6.0,24.0,The Bon Voyage Reaction
 Yeah.,Leonard,6.0,24.0,The Bon Voyage Reaction

" Very well. Things between you and Penny have never been better. I hope four months apart doesn’t change anything. I should have opened with that, huh?",Sheldon,6.0,24.0,The Bon Voyage Reaction
" So, anyway, last night on video chat, I spent, like, twenty minutes just staring into Lucy’s eyes.",Raj,6.0,24.0,The Bon Voyage Reaction

" I’d love that, but she’s not really comfortable around people.",Raj,6.0,24.0,The Bon Voyage Reaction
" Yeah, I used to be uncomfortable around people, but then I learned a trick. I pretend everyone I meet is a beloved character from Star Trek.",Sheldon,6.0,24.0,The Bon Voyage Reaction
 How’s that been working for you?,Leonard,6.0,24.0,The Bon Voyage Reaction
