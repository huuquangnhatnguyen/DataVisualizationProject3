 Excuse me?,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" There’s no point, I just think it’s a good idea for a tee-shirt. ",Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Agreed, what’s your point?",Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" So if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it and either slit is observed it will not go through both slits. If it’s unobserved it will, however, if it’s observed after it’s left the plane but before it hits its target, it will not have gone through both slits.",Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Oh, take your time. I’ll just finish my crossword puzzle. Oh wait.",Receptionist,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 At least I didn’t have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out.,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Oh, come on. Who hasn’t seen this differential below “here I sit broken hearted?”",Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 What?,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" If by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men’s room at MIT, sure.",Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Holy smokes.,Penny,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" I have a board. If you like boards, this is my board.",Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode

 Yeah. ,Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" So you’re like, one of those, beautiful mind genius guys.",Penny,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Yeah, well, it’s just some quantum mechanics, with a little string theory doodling around the edges. That part there, that’s just a joke, it’s a spoof of the Bourne-Oppenheimer approximation.",Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Wow.,Penny,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Actually that’s my work.,Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode

 Just sit somewhere else.,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Well.,Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Do you want me to move?,Penny,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer it’s directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion, I could go on, but I think I’ve made my point. ",Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Here we go.,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 What’s the difference?,Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 What’s the difference?,Penny,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode

" Um, Penny, that’s where I sit.",Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Uh, do you guys mind if I start?",Penny,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" In all of them, that is the point.",Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 In what universe?,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" I didn’t invent them, they’re there.",Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" I think what Sheldon’s trying to say, is that Sagittarius wouldn’t have been our first guess.",Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Participate in the what?,Penny,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality.",Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Um, me, okay, I’m Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need to know.",Penny,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Yeah, it’s like regular boggle but, in Klingon. That’s probably enough about us, tell us about you.",Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" So, Klingon boggle?",Penny,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 I said I’m sorry.,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 That is an antisocial implication.,Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 I’m sorry.,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 I resent you saying we don’t have company.,Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Yes, I remember.",Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Tuesday night we played Klingon boggle until one in the morning.,Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Yes I now, but…",Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 That’s not true. Koothrapali and Wolowitz come over all the time. ,Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Well this is nice. We don’t have a lot of company over.,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Aaah!,Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 I don’t know.,back),1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 What’s happening.,(mouths),1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 It was. Until I fell in love with a jerk. ,Penny,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Well it sounds wonderful.,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" I know, right? Okay, let’s see, what else? Um, that’s about it. That’s the story of Penny.",Penny,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Well, if that was a movie I would go see it.",Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" No, I’m from Omaha. ",Penny,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 So it’s based on your life?,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Oh, anyways, I’m also writing a screenplay. It’s about this sensitive girl who comes to L.A. from Lincoln Nebraska to be an actress, and winds up a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.",Penny,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" I don’t eat it, I just think it’s a good idea.",Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode

 That’s interesting. Leonard can’t process corn.,Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Oh, yeah, a lot of people think I’m a water sign. Okay, let’s see, what else, oh, I’m a vegetarian, oh, except for fish, and the occasional steak, I love steak. ",Penny,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 No.,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 No?,Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 No.,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Yes. ,Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it?,Penny,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Our shower works.,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Oh, I’m so sorry, I’m such a mess, and on top of everything else I’m all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn’t even work.",Penny,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" No, it’s not crazy it’s, uh, uh, it’s a paradox. And paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. Now if you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. Well, I didn’t make it worse.",Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Yes. ,Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" You want to know the most pathetic part? Even though I hate his lying, cheating guts, I still love him. Is that crazy?",Penny,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" You? No, you’ll only make it worse.",Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" I just, I can’t believe I trusted him.",Penny,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Don’t.,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 It took you four years to get through High School?,Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode

" Yes, but not of the same species.",Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" What makes you think she wouldn’t have sex with me, I’m a male and she’s a female?",Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Oh, good. Then you won’t be disappointed.",Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Well I’m not trying to have sex with her.,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 That woman in there’s not going to have sex with you.,Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Excuse me?,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?",Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Point taken. It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn’t want to rip our eyes out. ,Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" That’s not true, remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with Alzheimer’s had that episode.",Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.,Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode

 Why?,Raj,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode

 It’s before he became a creepy computer voice:.,Howard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 This is not a good time.,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 It’s a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.,Howard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 See what?,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 It’s fantastic. Unbelievable.,Raj,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Wait till you see this.,Howard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 It’s Darth Vader shampoo. (There is a knock on the door.) Luke Skywalker’s the conditioner.,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?,Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 That’s not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that I wouldn’t participate. However briefly.,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Oh, of course.",Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" I’m not going to engage in hypotheticals here, I’m just trying to be a good neighbour.",Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Save it for your blog, Howard.",Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode

 I’m sorry?,Penny,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Bon douche.,Howard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Come on, I’ll show you the trick with the shower.",Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Penny. I work at the Cheesecake Factory.,Penny,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Enchante Madamoiselle. Howard Wolowitz, Cal-Tech department of Applied Physics. You may be familiar with some of my work, it’s currently orbiting Jupiter’s largest moon taking high-resolution digital photographs.",Howard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Hey, is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower. Oh. Hi, sorry. Hello!",Penny,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Technically that would be coitus interruptus.,Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Can we please stop saying coitus?,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 So she’s available for coitus?,Howard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 I’m not anticipating coitus.,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 And you want us out because you’re anticipating coitus?,Howard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Uh-huh.,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Hang on, there really is a lady here?",Howard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" No. And she’s not a lady, she’s just a new neighbour.",Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Must we?,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.,Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Leonard and Sheldon, Inside Leonard’s car",Scene,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Wow.,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 It’s just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you’ve just met.,Penny,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Oh, I’ll probably say yes.",Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 It’s okay if you say no.,Penny,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode

" No, Sheldon, there’s not going to be a scene. There’s two of us and one of him.",Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 So we get to have a scene with him?,Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. There’s some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" You did not break up with Joyce Kim, she defected to North Korea.",Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Wuh, I, I broke up with Joyce Kim.",Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 No I don’t. And neither do you.,Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Come on, you know how it is with break-ups.",Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Oh, right, yes, I could have stayed behind and watched Wolowitz try to hit on Penny in Russian, Arabic and Farsi. Why can’t she get her own TV.",Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 That’s a biological impossibility and you didn’t have to come.,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 You think with your penis.,Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Which is?,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Ah, yes, well that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause.",Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" She asked me to do her a favour, Sheldon.",Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Event A. A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. Event B. We drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman’s ex-boyfriend. Query, on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events?",Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Excuse me, if I were to give up at the first little hitch I never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang.",Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Leonard, the TV is in the building, we’ve been denied access to the building, ergo we are done.",Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 We’re not going to give up just like that.,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Okay, thanks for your time.",Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Get lost.,Voice,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" What did I just…. Uh, we’re here to pick up Penny’s TV.",Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode

 I’ll do the talking.,buzzer),1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Outside Penny’s old apartment building.,Scene,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 He’s kind of a nerd. Juice box?,Howard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode

" Oh, he speaks English, he just can’t speak to women.",Howard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Uh, I’m sorry, do you speak English?",Penny,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" So, you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon at the University?",Raj),1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Leonard.,Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode

 Outside Penny’s ex-boyfriend’s apartment.,Scene,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Just grab the door.,Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode

" Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360, we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building.",Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 It’s just a privilege to watch your mind at work.,Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 My apologies. What’s your plan.,Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode

" Thank you Sheldon, you’re a good friend.",Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Don’t think like that, you’re not going to die alone.",Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Anyway, I’ve learned my lesson. She’s out of my league, I’m done with her, I’ve got my work, one day I’ll win the Nobel Prize and then I’ll die alone.",Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
 Well you got me out of my pants.,Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" And you were right about my motives, I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex.",Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" It’s okay. It wasn’t my first pantsing, and it won’t be my last.",Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" Sheldon, I’m so sorry I dragged you through this.",Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode

 That was a valid hypothesis? What is happening to you?,Sheldon,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" No, it was a valid hypothesis.",Leonard,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode
" I’m so sorry, I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn’t be such an ass.",Penny,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode

 Smooth.,Raj,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode

 Any ideas Raj? (He just looks at her with a worried expression.),Penny,1.0,1.0,Pilot Episode

 Are you upset about something? ,Sheldon,1.0,14.0,The Nerdvana Annihilation

 It won’t change the past. ,Sheldon,1.0,14.0,The Nerdvana Annihilation
 What if I knocked you unconscious right now? ,Leonard,1.0,14.0,The Nerdvana Annihilation

 Those are movies.,Leonard,1.0,14.0,The Nerdvana Annihilation
" In addition, your premise is flawed. In the original film, Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimeaux with that very time machine. In Back to the Future, Marty McFly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother. ",Sheldon,1.0,14.0,The Nerdvana Annihilation
 Thanks for pointing it out.,Leonard,1.0,14.0,The Nerdvana Annihilation

Now, since no-one knows when or if the poison has been released, until the box is opened, the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead. ",Sheldon,1.0,17.0,The Tangerine Factor
" I’m sorry, I don’t get the point. ",Penny,1.0,17.0,The Tangerine Factor
" Well of course you don’t get it, I haven’t made it yet. You’d have to be psychic to get it, and there’s no such thing as psychic.",Sheldon,1.0,17.0,The Tangerine Factor
" Sheldon, what’s the point? ",Penny,1.0,17.0,The Tangerine Factor
" Well, he didn’t actually say anything, but when he came back to the apartment he was doing a dance that brought to mind the happy hippos in Fantasia. ",Sheldon,1.0,17.0,The Tangerine Factor
" Oh, that’s nice. Anyhow, the thing I wanted to talk to you about is, you know, since Leonard and I have become friends, I was just… want to sit down? ",Penny,1.0,17.0,The Tangerine Factor
" Oh, I wish it were that simple. You see, I don’t spend much time here and so I’ve never really chosen a place to sit. ",Sheldon,1.0,17.0,The Tangerine Factor
" Well, choose.",Penny,1.0,17.0,The Tangerine Factor
" There are a number of options and, I’m really not familiar enough with the cushion densities, air flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight to make an informed choice.",Sheldon,1.0,17.0,The Tangerine Factor
" Alright, why don’t you just pick one at random, and then if you don’t like it you can sit somewhere else next time. ",Penny,1.0,17.0,The Tangerine Factor
" No, no, that’s crazy. You go ahead and talk while I figure it out. ",Sheldon,1.0,17.0,The Tangerine Factor
" Okay. Um, here’s the thing. So, I’ve known for a while now that Leonard has had a little crush on me…",Penny,1.0,17.0,The Tangerine Factor
" Wow, that’s brilliant.",Leonard,1.0,17.0,The Tangerine Factor

 Leonard approaches Penny’s door. He is wearing a suit. He knocks. Penny answers.,Scene,1.0,17.0,The Tangerine Factor

 I’m going to talk anyway.,Leonard,1.0,17.0,The Tangerine Factor
 I assumed you would. ,Sheldon,1.0,17.0,The Tangerine Factor
" I would not say that. No-one would say that, a light year is a unit of distance, not time. ",Sheldon,1.0,17.0,The Tangerine Factor
 Thank you for the clarification. ,Penny,1.0,17.0,The Tangerine Factor
" Draft. You see people hear the word year and they think duration. Foot pound has the same problem, that’s a unit of work, not of weight.",Sheldon,1.0,17.0,The Tangerine Factor

" Just like Schrodinger’s Cat, your potential relationship with Leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad. It is only by opening the box that you’ll find out which it is. ",Sheldon,1.0,17.0,The Tangerine Factor
