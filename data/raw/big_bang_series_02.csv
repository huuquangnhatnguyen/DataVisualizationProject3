 It’s also not pink and has no berries.,Leonard,2.0,1.0,The Bad Fish Paradigm

 Oh now you’re just making stuff up.,Sheldon,2.0,2.0,The Codpiece Topology

 Hang on a second. Loop quantum gravity clearly offers more testable predictions than string theory.,Leslie,2.0,2.0,The Codpiece Topology
" I will graciously overlook the fact that she is an arrogant sub-par scientist, who actually believes loop quantum gravity better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity than does string theory. You kids have fun.",Sheldon,2.0,2.0,The Codpiece Topology
 Thank you.,Leonard,2.0,2.0,The Codpiece Topology

 In which I am not an expert.,Sheldon,2.0,9.0,The White Asparagus Triangulation
 Are you insane? Now she’s going to think I’m desperate. You’ve destroyed this relationship! And you want to know what the worst part is? You don’t even understand what you did wrong because you can’t conceive of something that you are not an expert in!,Leonard,2.0,9.0,The White Asparagus Triangulation
" Oh, it’s hardly hacking when you use the same password for everything, Kal-el.",Sheldon,2.0,9.0,The White Asparagus Triangulation

 Really?,Penny,2.0,9.0,The White Asparagus Triangulation
" You say that now, but consider the following scenario, you’re sitting in your apartment, it’s late, you’re alone, your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and progesterone and suddenly even Leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate, or a, uh, hookup as it’s referred to by today’s urban youth.",Sheldon,2.0,9.0,The White Asparagus Triangulation
" Yeah, I think she’s pretty safe.",Penny,2.0,9.0,The White Asparagus Triangulation
" Anyway, should you have any interaction with her, it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival.",Sheldon,2.0,9.0,The White Asparagus Triangulation
" Well, aren’t you sweet?",Penny,2.0,9.0,The White Asparagus Triangulation
" No, I didn’t try, I succeeded. In fact, I was briefly able to see the inside of my sister’s guinea pig, Snowball, before he caught fire. It led to an interesting expression in our house, not a snowball’s chance in a cat scanner.",Sheldon,2.0,9.0,The White Asparagus Triangulation

" Hi, Sheldon.",Steph,2.0,9.0,The White Asparagus Triangulation

 I stand corrected.,Leonard,2.0,9.0,The White Asparagus Triangulation
 And you said there’d never be enough pasta for the three of us.,Sheldon,2.0,9.0,The White Asparagus Triangulation

" Penny, Penny, Penny. Everything you’re saying is true, but please allow me to continue. Raj, you’re out. The good question, while you do provide a certain cultural diversity to an otherwise homogenous group, your responses to the questionnaire were truly disturbing.

" Sheldon, are you okay?",Penny,2.0,13.0,The Friendship Algorithm
" Oh yes, I pass out all the time. But, it was worth it. I’ve made substantial progress in bonding with Kripke, which brings me to an awkward moment.",Sheldon,2.0,13.0,The Friendship Algorithm
 What’s that?,Leonard,2.0,13.0,The Friendship Algorithm
" Maintaining five friendships promises to be a Herculean task. So, I’m going to have to let one of you go.",Sheldon,2.0,13.0,The Friendship Algorithm

 No? But we’re friends!,Sheldon,2.0,13.0,The Friendship Algorithm

 I’m confused. I was given an understanding that you allow your friends time on the machine?,Sheldon,2.0,13.0,The Friendship Algorithm
" Really? That seems rather short sighted, coming from someone who is generally considered altogether unlikable. Why don’t you take some time to reconsider?",Sheldon,2.0,13.0,The Friendship Algorithm

" Alright Sheldon, why is tapioca…",Howard,2.0,13.0,The Friendship Algorithm
 Tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant Manihot Esculenta. Due to a high concentration of cyanide it is poisonous in its raw form and lethal if prepared improperly.,Sheldon,2.0,13.0,The Friendship Algorithm
 Feel better now?,Raj,2.0,13.0,The Friendship Algorithm
 And you moved in anyway?,Penny,2.0,13.0,The Friendship Algorithm
 I assumed he was joking. You’d be surprised how many particle physicists have a whimsical side.,Leonard,2.0,13.0,The Friendship Algorithm
" Mmm, gentlemen, I put it to you, the worst tapioca pudding is better than the best pudding of any other flavour.",Raj,2.0,13.0,The Friendship Algorithm

 That’s it? Did he give any reason as to why he came to this moral epiphany?,Leonard,2.0,14.0,The Financial Permeability
" Yes, he said he was feeling guilty and wanted to do what was right.",Penny,2.0,14.0,The Financial Permeability
 Really? Did he say why?,Leonard,2.0,14.0,The Financial Permeability

 I’m not in San Francisco. I’m on a train. Were you even listening to me?,Sheldon,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
" Well, there’s nothing you can do about it, so relax, sit back, enjoy the clickety-clack of the steel wheels on the polished rails.",Leonard,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling

" Okay, I’ve found the perfect solution. We get off the train at the next stop in Oxnard. We then take the 1:13 train back to Union Station. We take a cab back to the apartment, get my flash drive, and then race to San Luis Obispo, where, assuming the lights are with us and minimal traffic, we’ll meet the train.",Sheldon,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
 I’ve got a better idea.,Leonard,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
 Are you going to be sarcastic?,Sheldon,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
" Boy, you take all the fun out of it for me.  But look, Penny’s home. Why don’t we just call her, have her go in the apartment, get your flash drive and e-mail you the paper?",Leonard,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
" And that bright little star peeking her head out early today, that’s Venus.",Raj,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
 That is so cool. You really know a lot about space.,Summer,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
 Thank you.,Leonard,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
" You’re not one of those guys who really believe that, are you?",Summer,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
" You mean one of the hopeless geeks? No. Those are crazy people. Howard, be a dear and get me another one of these. Now, him, he’s one of those geeks.",Raj,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
" All right, now, before you enter my bedroom unescorted, I need you to understand that this onetime grant of access does not create a permanent easement. Easement. It’s a legal right",Sheldon,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
" Do you believe him? Normally around women, he has the personality of a boiled potato. Put one beer in him, and he’s M. Night Charmalarmalon.",Howard,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
 Is that what he’s drinking? It’s not even real beer.,Leonard,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
" Oh, I hate when that happens.",Sheldon,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling

 You got me. Now what are you going to do with me?,Raj,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
 Raj.,Howard,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling

 Look.,Howard,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
 What am I looking at?,Raj,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling

" Hey, Leonard. What’s going on with Dr. Wackadoodle?",Penny,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
" He’s calling to ask you a favour. You might be confused because he didn’t use the words, Penny, Sheldon, please or favour.",Leonard,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
" Okay. Enough chitchat. Okay, step one, locate your emergency key to our apartment. Step two, enter our apartment. Step three, enter my bedroom.",Sheldon,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
" Oh, hang on, Sheldon, getting another call.",Penny,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
" No! Leonard, let me tell you something. Personal robots cannot get here soon enough.",Sheldon,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
" Delightful. Listen, I don’t know what you’re doing right now, but there are little bubbles forming on the corners of Sheldon’s mouth.",Leonard,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
" Okay, yeah, I kind of crossed a line. Put him back on.",Penny,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
 I’m sorry. This is me.,Summer,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
 I’m back.,Sheldon,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling

 Nobody calls me Moon Pie but Meemaw!,Sheldon,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
" Hey, Penny. Leonard again.",Leonard,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
" So anyway, in the dream, you and I were ice skating, just the two of us. And then, I picked you up by your ankles and twirled you round and round until your legs tore off. I tried to stick them back on, but before I could, you turned into a giant loaf of pumpernickel bread. What do you think that means?",Howard,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
 What?,Howard,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
 Look at it. Non-alcoholic beer.,Leonard,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
 What’s going on?,Howard,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
" I don’t know. Some sort of placebo effect, I guess.",Leonard,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
" Placebo, you say. Interesting.",Howard,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
" Yes, I’m still here. Where am I going? I’m on a train. Now, what you’ll be looking for is a small wooden box located between a Hoberman’s sphere and a sample of quartz flecked with pyrite. Hoberman’s Sphere. It’s a collapsible icosidodecahedron. No, the thing with the time on it is my alarm clock.",Sheldon,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling

 You’re making that up.,Summer,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
" But before I go, would you mind if I just take one picture of us together for my Facebook page?",Howard,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
 Sure.,Summer,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
" Okay. Great. Now, can I take one where it looks like we’re making out?",Howard,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
" Okay, now you’re going to insert the flash drive into the USB port. She calls me Moon Pie because I’m nummy-nummy and she could just eat me up, now, please put the flash drive in the USB port. The one that looks like a little duck’s mouth.",Sheldon,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
" Hey, how’d it go?",Leonard,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
 Terminator broke my phone.,Howard,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
" Excuse me. (Goes down to Summer) Okay, I’ll be honest with you. I’ve just spent the last two hours imagining various scenarios in my head, trying to come up with some clever line to say to you. But then I finally realized you’re a human being; I’m a human being. I could just say to you…",Leonard,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
 Not yet. (Puts box on ground and stomps on it)There it is.,Penny,2.0,17.0,The Terminator Decoupling
 You underestimate me.,Howard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 The apartment.,Scene,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Let’s find out. Leonard, ready?",Raj,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Ready.,Leonard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Go. (Leonard sprays an aerosol which lights up laser beams. He tries to negotiate the beams as Howard and Raj sing dramatic music. Eventually he touches one of the beams and a buzzer sounds.),Raj,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Damn it. I slipped.,Leonard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Too bad. You know the rules of Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Chess. Uh, Leonard died again, Sheldon. You’re up.",Howard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Despite my deep love of chess, lasers and aerosol disinfectant, I must forfeit.",Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Why?,Leonard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 – Because it’s almost eleven o’clock.,Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 So?,Leonard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" So, Penny has a don’t knock on my door before eleven o’clock  or I punch you in the throat rule.",Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Ah.,All,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Hey, you know what’d be a great idea? We get some girls over here and play Laser Obstacle Strip Chess.",Howard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Believe me, Howard, any girl who would be willing to play that, you don’t want to see naked.",Leonard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, look, look! I started a business.",Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster

" No, I’m making flower barrettes. See? I call them Penny Blossoms. I made one for myself, then all the girls at work wanted one. Then I showed some to this lady who runs a shop in Old Town. She sells cards and homemade jewellery. She said she wanted to sell them. I said okay, and in one week, I made a $156.",Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Good for you. Sign here.,Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Sheldon, don’t you get it? If this takes off, I won’t have to be a waitress anymore.",Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 But then who will bring me my cheeseburger on Tuesday nights?,Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Another waitress.,Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 What’s her name?,Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 I don’t know.,Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 And you’re going to let her handle my food?,Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Nancy. Her name is Nancy.,Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 I think you’re just making that up.,Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Sheldon, I’m sorry about your hamburger, okay? I just don’t want to be a waitress for the rest of my life.",Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Cheeseburger. I get a cheeseburger.,Leonard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Fine, cheeseburger.",Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Maybe I’d be better off with Nancy.,Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" So, what do you think? I mean, this could be a business, right?",Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 How many of these can you make a day?,Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 About twenty.,Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 And how much profit do you make per Penny Blossom?,Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" I don’t know, like, 50 cents. I’m not sure.",Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" No, Of course you’re not. All right, ten dollars a day times five days a week times 52 weeks a year is two thousand six hundred dollars.",Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 That’s all?,Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Before taxes.,Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Well, I don’t have to pay taxes on this stuff.",Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" I believe the Internal Revenue Service would strongly disagree. But, if you took advantage of modern marketing techniques, and you optimized your manufacturing process, you might be able to make this a viable business.",Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 And you know about that stuff?,Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Penny, I’m a physicist. I have a working knowledge of the entire universe and everything it contains.",Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Who’s Radiohead?,Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 I have a working knowledge of the important things in the universe. Good luck.,Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Sheldon, hold on. Could you maybe show me how to make more money with this?",Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Of course I could.,Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Sheldon, wait! Will you?",Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Just to be clear here, you’re asking for my assistance.",Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Yes.,Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 And you understand that will involve me telling you what to do?,Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 I understand.,Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 And you’re not allowed to be sarcastic or snide to me while I’m doing so.,Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Okay.,Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Good. Let’s begin with the premise that everything you’ve done up to this point is wrong.,Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Oh, imagine that.",Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Sarcasm. Good-bye.,Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster

 Penny’s apartment. Penny is making a barette. Sheldon is timing her.,Scene,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 There. Done.,Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 All right. 12 minutes and 17 seconds.,Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Pretty good, right?",Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" That’s 4.9 Penny Blossoms per hour. Based on your cost of materials and your wholesale selling price, you’ll effectively be paying yourself… $5.19 a day.",Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 A day?,Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 There are children in a sneaker factory in Indonesia who outearn you.,Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 That just can’t be right.,Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 You’re questioning my math?,Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" No, sorry.",Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Want me to show my work?,Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster

" All right, are you familiar with the development that resulted from Honoré Blanc’s 1778 use of interchangeable parts? The assembly line, of course.",Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Okay, you know what, if I’m not allowed to be snide, you’re not allowed to be condescending.",Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" That wasn’t a part of our original agreement, and I do not agree to it now.",Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" All right, fine. How are we supposed to set up machines and conveyor belts in my apartment?",Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" You’re thinking of the moving assembly line, an understandable but not excusable mistake. No. The moving assembly line, that was introduced by Henry Ford in 1908. That innovation is what made possible our modern consumer culture by enabling a low-unit cost for manufactured goods.

 Let’s go. We’re going to miss the coming attractions.,Leonard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 What’s the matter?,Raj,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 I think I bruised a testicle capturing that last pawn.,Howard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Hello?,Leonard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Hello. (They resume singing and working) ,together,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" W-W-Wait, what’s going on?",Leonard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 I assume you’re referring to the sea shanty. It’s a rhythmic work song designed to increase productivity.,Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Yeah, it’s crazy, but it totally works. Look, we made this Penny Blossom in under three minutes.",Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Terrific, but that kind of raises more questions than it answers.",Leonard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Penny’s making hair accessories. I’m helping her optimize her manufacturing process. All right, break’s over. (They start singing again.)",Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Hold on. What are you using as a bonding agent?,Howard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Hot glue.,Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 You’re kidding. Any of the cyanoacrylates would do a better job.,Howard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" It won’t work, the flower’s too porous.",Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 What if we infused the bottom layer with silicone-RTV to provide a better mounting surface?,Leonard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Intriguing.,Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Good question, what are you marketing and distribution channels?",him),2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Well, there are the waitresses at my work, and this cute, little shop in Old Town.",Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush, virtually non-existent. I’m thinking that we set her up with a hosted turnkey e-commerce system to start.",Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Why not eliminate the middle man? We could install a small server farm with a static IP in her bedroom.,Howard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 She’d need some kind of industrial cooling system.,Leonard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Of course, but before we set up a marketing and distribution infrastructure, we should finish optimizing the manufacturing process. To start with, she has a terrible problem with moisture-induced glitter clump.",Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Yeah, it’s a bitch.",Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Uh, I’ve seen this before.",Howard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Where?,Leonard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" It’s a common stripper problem. They dance, they sweat, they clump.",Howard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Ew.,Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Are you thinking about adding a desiccant like calcium sulphate?,Leonard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Actually, I’m thinking about this one stripper named Vega. But sure, calcium sulphate could work.",Howard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Let’s think out of the box for a moment. How about a molecular sieve?,Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Oh!,Howard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 I’ve got a spaghetti strainer in the kitchen.,Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Wow.,Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Hey, we could liberate some micro-porous charcoal from the chem lab.",Leonard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Oh, great. Raj, why don’t you and Howard go get the charcoal? Leonard, why don’t you start working on some preliminary Web site designs. I’ll make some space in our apartment so we can move the manufacturing process.",Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Well, what’s wrong with my apartment?",Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 It’s not my apartment.,Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster

 – What’s wrong with it?,Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Not you. I wasn’t asking you. Penny?,Leonard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Uh, well, it’s a little juvenile. I mean, it kind of looks like the MySpace page of a 13-year-old girl.",Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" No, it doesn’t.",Leonard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Please. Dateline could use it to attract predators.,Howard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Penny, this is your enterprise, so it’s ultimately your decision, but based on the quality of his work, I’d strongly recommend that we let Leonard go.",Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster

" Thank you, Penny Blossoms. These will be perfect to cover my bald spot. Aww, that is so sweet.",Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Camouflaging bald spots. That’s primarily a male concern. Perhaps we could expand our market.,Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 How are flower barrettes going to appeal to men?,Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 We add Bluetooth!,Howard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster

 Holy crap. Someone just ordered a thousand Penny Blossoms.,Leonard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster

 We should get to work.,Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Wait, wait, wait, why does it say one-day rush? Since when do we offer a one-day rush?",Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Amazon offers one-day rush.,Leonard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Yeah, but they don’t have to glue the books together. How the hell are we going to make a thousand Penny Blossoms in one day?",Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 Don’t yell at me. I’m not manufacturing. I’m just Web design.,Leonard,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Okay, well, I’m gonna have to call them and cancel the order.",Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Excuse me, but was this not your goal? Financial independence through entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation? My brilliance and innovation, of course, but still.",Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
 I just don’t see how see can pull this off.,Penny,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster
" Okay, that, right there, that equivocation and self-doubt, that is not the American spirit. Did Davy Crockett quit at the Alamo? Did Jim Bowie?",Sheldon,2.0,18.0,The Work Song Nanocluster

" You know, Penny, there’s something that occurs in beehives you might find interesting. Occasionally, a new queen will arrive while the old queen is still in power.

 I thought you were good at this. You’re always talking about how you go to bars and meet women.,Leonard,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
" I do, all the time.",Howard,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
" Well, what happened? We’ve been sitting here all night and the longest conversation you’ve had with a woman was when your mom called.",Leonard,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope

 Say what?,Leonard,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
 You’re weighing me down. I’m a falcon who hunts better solo.,Howard,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
 Fine. I’ll sit here. You take flight and hunt.,Leonard,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope

" Shut up. Let’s just get Koothrappali and go. (They turn to see Raj with his tongue down the throat of a “larger lady” by the bar.) Lucky bastard. It’s got to be that stupid accent of his. (To a girl nearby) Hello. I am Sanjay Wolowitz from Bombay. Okay, I’m stumped.",Howard,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
" Yes, but we all agreed that the third Thursday of every month would be Anything Can Happen Thursday.",Leonard,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
" Well apparently the news didn’t reach my digestive system, which, when startled, has its own version of Anything Can Happen Thursday.",Sheldon,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
" Come on, the whole idea behind Anything Can Happen Thursday is to get out of this rut we’ve been in lately.",Howard,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
" Rut? I think you mean consistency. And if we’re going to abandon that, then why even call it Thursday? Let’s call it Quonko Day and divide it into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece, and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the mighty god Ra.",Sheldon,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
 I could go for some goat.,Raj,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope

 All right. Let’s go to the comic book store.,Sheldon,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
 We went to the comic book store last night.,Raj,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope

" Way to think outside but pressed right up against the box, Sheldon.",Leonard,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
 So what are we going to do tonight?,Raj,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
" If I may proffer a suggestion, in bars all across this great nation of ours, Thursday night is Ladies’ Night. Which means, as the evening progresses, we will get better looking courtesy of 99 cent margaritas and two-for-one Jell-O shots.",Howard,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
" Come on, Howard, the odds of us picking up girls in a bar are practically zero.",Leonard,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
 Really? Are you familiar with the Drake Equation?,Howard,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
" The one that estimates the odds of making contact with extraterrestrials by calculating the product of an increasingly restrictive series of fractional values such as those stars with planets, and those planets likely to develop life? N equals R times FP times NE times FL times FI times FC times L?",Sheldon,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
" Yeah, that one. You can modify it to calculate our chances of having sex by changing the formula to use the number of single women in Los Angeles, the number of those who might find us attractive, and what I call the Wolowitz Coefficient.",Howard,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
 The Wolowitz Coefficient?,Raj,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
" Neediness times dress size squared. Crunching the numbers, I come up with a conservative 5,812 potential sex partners within a 40-mile radius.",Howard,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope

" I’m a horny engineer, Leonard. I never joke about math or sex.",Howard,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
" Well, what are we waiting for? Let’s bounce, bitches.",Raj,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
" You’re right. It’s Anything Can Happen Thursday, let’s hit the clubs and meet hot women!",Leonard,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
 Here we go. Lock up your daughters! We’re going to hit it and quit it.,Raj,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
 Or we could finish eating and go to the comic book store.,Leonard,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
 Also a good plan.,Raj,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
" Alright, but next Anything Can Happen Thursday, we’re definitely going to a bar.",Howard,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
" Oh, absolutely.",Leonard,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
" You heard that, Ladies’ Night ladies? We’re eventually coming for you!",Raj,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
 Fascinating.,Sheldon,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
" Oh hey, guys, where’re you headed?",Penny,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
" To the comic book store. You’re probably thinking, the comic book store? On a Thursday? Why, I’ve fallen down the rabbit hole and into a land of madness. What you have failed to take into account, Penny, is that this is Anything Can Happen Thursday.",Sheldon,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
" You got me. While you’re there, could pick me up a few comics for my nephew’s birthday?",Penny,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
 I think you mean comic books. Comics are feeble attempts at humour featuring talking babies and anthropomorphized pets found traditionally in the optimistically named funny pages.,Sheldon,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
" Leonard, could you pick me up a few comics for my nephew’s birthday?",Penny,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope

" I don’t know, he’s 13. Just pick out anything.",Penny,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
" Just pick out anything? Maybe at the same time we can pick out a new suit for him without knowing his size, or pick out his career for him without knowing his aptitude, or pick out a new breakfast cereal without knowing his fibre requirements or his feelings about little marshmallows.",Sheldon,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
 Spider-Man. Get him Spider-Man.,Penny,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope

 It’s really good.,Penny,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope

 Would you rather I offer my personal insight?,Sheldon,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
 I don’t need any insights. I just want to know why Penny’s more interested in Stuart than me. We’re practically the same guy.,Leonard,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope

 More wrong? Wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation.,Sheldon,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope
" Of course it is. It’s a little wrong to say a tomato is a vegetable, it’s very wrong to say it’s a suspension bridge. But returning to the original issue, Dick Grayson became Nightwing, a superhero in his own right. Batman 2 has to be the second Robin, Jason Todd.",Stuart,2.0,20.0,The Hofstadter Isotope

 Good one.,Leonard,2.0,22.0,The Classified Materials Turbulence
 Yeah.,Raj,2.0,22.0,The Classified Materials Turbulence
" Yeah, ha, it’s hilarious. Now, here’s an approximation of the spare parts available on the Space Station. We gotta find a way, using nothing but this, to reinforce this so the waste material avoids the spinning turbine.",Howard,2.0,22.0,The Classified Materials Turbulence
 You mean so it doesn’t hit the fan?,Raj,2.0,22.0,The Classified Materials Turbulence

" Yeah, I’m sorry, it’s been broken.",Leonard,2.0,22.0,The Classified Materials Turbulence
 Or e-mail.,Stuart,2.0,22.0,The Classified Materials Turbulence
" Yeah, that too. Everything’s broken.",Leonard,2.0,22.0,The Classified Materials Turbulence
" Anyway, I was just wondering if you had any last-minute advice.",Stuart,2.0,22.0,The Classified Materials Turbulence
" All right, well, off the top of my head, I think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow. I mean, glacial.",Leonard,2.0,22.0,The Classified Materials Turbulence
 Okay.,Stuart,2.0,22.0,The Classified Materials Turbulence
" You know, guys come onto her all the time, so, you need to, like, set yourself apart. You know, be a little shy, don’t make too much eye contact. And, you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment and, and, and, you know, fear.",Leonard,2.0,22.0,The Classified Materials Turbulence
 Fear?,Stuart,2.0,22.0,The Classified Materials Turbulence

" No good. I mean, it might work for the Japanese and the Americans, but have you seen the size of the Russians they got up there? This thing has to hold up against a hearty potato-based diet.",Howard,2.0,22.0,The Classified Materials Turbulence
 I feel terrible.,Leonard,2.0,22.0,The Classified Materials Turbulence
" Maybe if you were helping, you’d feel better about yourself.",Howard,2.0,22.0,The Classified Materials Turbulence

" You don’t really believe in that superstition, do you?",Sheldon,2.0,22.0,The Classified Materials Turbulence
" It’s not superstition. It’s practically Newtonian. For every action, there’s an equal and opposite reaction. Leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch, therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug. It’s actually a very elegant system, you know, what goes around comes around.",Raj,2.0,22.0,The Classified Materials Turbulence
 Speaking of what goes around comes around…,Howard,2.0,22.0,The Classified Materials Turbulence
" Okay, look. Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here, what if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely?",Raj,2.0,22.0,The Classified Materials Turbulence
 It won’t work. The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.,Sheldon,2.0,22.0,The Classified Materials Turbulence
 What if we reposition the collection tank?,Raj,2.0,22.0,The Classified Materials Turbulence
 It won’t work. No way to mount it.,Sheldon,2.0,22.0,The Classified Materials Turbulence

 Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravity… pasta maker. I’m gonna make a coffee run. Do you want any?,Leonard,2.0,22.0,The Classified Materials Turbulence
" Oh, no, thanks. I have coffee.",Penny,2.0,22.0,The Classified Materials Turbulence
 Great. So how’d it go with Stuart last night?,Leonard,2.0,22.0,The Classified Materials Turbulence
 I really don’t want to talk about it.,Penny,2.0,22.0,The Classified Materials Turbulence

" If you knew what you were doing, there wouldn’t be a space toilet where my coffee table should be.",Sheldon,2.0,22.0,The Classified Materials Turbulence
" Howard, wait. Why don’t you use this instead of the PVC to keep the transverse filter assembly in place?",Raj,2.0,22.0,The Classified Materials Turbulence
 Because this is not a spare part from the space station. This is the thing from the pizza box that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.,Howard,2.0,22.0,The Classified Materials Turbulence

 It’s a blanket with sleeves.,Leonard,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition

" Yes, obviously.",Leonard,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" All right. Well, given that missing you is predicated on you leaving, logic dictates you must leave.",Sheldon,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition

 Why?,Leonard,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition

" Okay, well, do you want to go?",Leonard,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" Of course not. I’m a theoretical physicist, a career I chose in no small part because it’s indoors, but if I’m able to detect slow-moving magnetic monopoles there, I will be the scientist to confirm string theory.

 Really?,Howard,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" Well, there are others who might be more qualified, but the thought of interviewing them gave me a stomach ache. Now, I know I’m proposing an enormous undertaking, so why don’t you take a few moments to discuss it?",Sheldon,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition

" Now, honey, I already told you, the hamburger meat is fresh and stored at a safe temperature.",Penny,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" Alright, now the purpose of this drill is to acclimate us to the use of tools in extreme temperatures such as we will face in the Arctic Circle.",Sheldon,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
 Where are your tools?,Raj,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" Right here. All right, team, open up your practice kits. As the university did not permit me to bring the actual equipment we’ll be using to the Cheesecake Factory, because apparently I’m “ridiculous,” I’ve provided substitutes which will exercise your fine motor skills. Leonard, you will be doing a series of complex mathematical problems on a vintage Casio model 1175 calculator watch I received when I won the Earth Science medal in 3rd grade. Treat it with respect. Raj, you will be painting sideburns and a Van Dyke on a six-inch figurine of Legolas the elf. Now, remember, a Van Dyke is a goatee without a moustache. Wolowitz, you will be completing a series of delicate surgical procedures on the classic children’s game, Operation. To begin with, you will remove funny bone for two hundred dollars.",brain),2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
 For this I went to MIT.,Howard,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
 Yes.,Sheldon,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
 For three months?,Penny,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
 Yes.,Sheldon,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
 Excuse me.,Penny,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
 Is that a yes or a no on the freezer? The woman has the attention span of a gnat.,Sheldon,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" Hey, Leonard.",Penny,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
 Hi.,Leonard,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
 Sheldon says you’re going to the North Pole.,Penny,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" Yeah. Pretty cool, huh?",Leonard,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
 Yeah. I’m just a little surprised you didn’t tell me.,Penny,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" Oh, well, it all happened kind of fast, and we had to get physicals and buy thermal underwear and study up on, you know, snow and stuff. Sorry, I was gonna tell you.",Leonard,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" Oh, hey, no, you don’t have to apologize. There’s no reason you have to tell me. I was just, you know, surprised.",Penny,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" Here, drink slash eat this.",Sheldon,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
 What is it?,Leonard,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
 It’s hot chocolate with a stick of butter.,Sheldon,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" Okay, why?",Howard,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
 Yeah.,Leonard,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" I’m sorry, but at what point do you put this see what you can do plan into action?",Sheldon,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" Just a warning, Sheldon, the freezer locks from the outside.",Penny,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
 Did she seem upset to you?,Leonard,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
 No. Did she seem upset to you?,Sheldon,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
 No.,Leonard,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" Oh, good, I got it right. Are you upset?",Sheldon,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
 A little bit.,Leonard,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
 Two for two. I’m on fire.,Sheldon,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" I mean, I know she’s not my girlfriend or anything, but wouldn’t you think she’d feel a little bad that I’m going to be gone for the whole summer?",Leonard,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" That feels like a bonus question. I’m going to stop here while I’m ahead, but I’ve had a great time.",Sheldon,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition

 I didn’t say that. You never listen to me!,Howard,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
 He doesn’t tell me anything! He lives a secret life because he’s ashamed!,Mother,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition

 Adversity is to be expected. Continue.,Sheldon,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" Oh, boy, am I gonna get sued.",Howard,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" Okay, I can’t do this.",Leonard,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
 Me either.,Raj,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" Gentlemen, use your imagination. Innovate. Did Han Solo let Luke Skywalker freeze to death on the ice planet of Hoth? No. He cut open a tauntaun and used its internal body heat to warm him up.",Sheldon,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
 You heard the man. Hold him down and I’ll cut him open.,Howard,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" Hang on, I know I don’t possess the tools of leadership, but I don’t understand why we can’t assemble the equipment inside the hut and then take it outside.",Leonard,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
 I hadn’t thought of that. I guess we’re done here.,Sheldon,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition

 But Meemaw just made cookies.,Sheldon,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" Listen, I don’t know if I can go on the expedition.",Leonard,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
 What?,Sheldon,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" Because in the frigid temperatures in the Arctic, we need to consume at least 5,000 calories a day just to maintain our body weight.",Sheldon,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" Sheldon, you know I can’t eat butter. I’m lactose intolerant.",Leonard,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition

" But mummy, all the other guys are going to the North Pole.",webcam),2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition

" If you were standing behind me nagging, I might.",Raj,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition

" No, it’s not. Howard, tell them.",Raj,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" Doctor and Mrs. Koothrappali, namaste. I understand your concern, but if it’ll make you feel any better, my mother is fine with me going, and this is a woman who kept a safety rail on my bed until I was 17.",Howard,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" So, she has no problem with her son being eaten by a walrus?",Koothrappali,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" That’s very unlikely, Mrs. Koothrappali. If Raj dies, it’ll be from frostbite, gangrene, acute sunburn or being ripped to shreds by a fifteen hundred pound polar bear.",Sheldon,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" Ma, I’m putting you on speakerphone with Raj’s parents. Can you tell them that you’re okay with me going to the Arctic?",Howard,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" Yes, okay, but I’m gonna be gone for three months. What if she doesn’t miss me that long and she meets someone else?",Leonard,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
 She does have a short attention span.,Sheldon,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" So, I can’t go.",Leonard,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" Leonard, you may be right. It appears that Penny secretly wants you in her life in a very intimate and carnal fashion.",Sheldon,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" Sure, but let’s go out here where there’s a little less yelling and guilt. What’s up?",Leonard,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" Well, I got you a little going away present.",Penny,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" Oh, a blanket.",Leonard,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" Oh, no, no, no, not just a blanket. See, it has sleeves. Yeah!  So, you can, you know, be all snoodled up while you do your science stuff.",Penny,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" Oh, wow, cool.",Leonard,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
" Oh, I’m gonna miss you. (She hugs him for a long time) See you later.",Penny,2.0,23.0,The Monopolar Expedition
