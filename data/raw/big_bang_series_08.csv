 A railway station. Sheldon is wearing no trousers.,Scene,8.0,1.0,The Locomotion Interruption
" Excuse me. Is it at all possible that you’re knitting a pair of pants? Oh, well, no, you’re understandably terrified. But, you know, allow me to explain. 45 days ago, um, I embarked on a railroad journey of healing because my university was making me do string theory, and my favorite comic book store burned down, and when my room mate got engaged, my girlfriend wanted to move in with me, which was no doubt a ploy just to see my, well, excuse my language, but my bathing suit parts. Uh, sir, may I use your phone?",Sheldon,8.0,1.0,The Locomotion Interruption
 I don’t think so.,Man,8.0,1.0,The Locomotion Interruption
" Yeah, well, I understand that I’m half naked, but there is a reasonable explanation. While I slept in my sleeper car, all my possessions were stolen. Now, typically, I wear pyjamas, but I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle and pyjamas are the sleep-pants of the Man. I’ll have you know, Mahatma Gandhi wore no pants and a nation rallied behind him. My good man, now, before you walk away, I know that I may appear deranged, but I am, in fact, a world-renowned physicist. Ask me the difference between a boson and a fermion. Go ahead, ask. Bosons have integer spin, fermions have half-integer spin. My legs are getting cold. Why won’t anybody help me?",Sheldon,8.0,1.0,The Locomotion Interruption

" Amy, may I please have a moment of privacy to speak with my roommate?",Sheldon,8.0,1.0,The Locomotion Interruption
 We’re in a moving car. What do you expect me to do? Stick my fingers in my ears?,Amy,8.0,1.0,The Locomotion Interruption
" Well, I was thinking put your head out the window like a dog, but that’ll work. Please? This’ll be quick. Leonard? As soon as we get home, I want to have coitus with Amy. Okay, she can’t hear.

 But you did do it. So what if it didn’t all go your way? That’s what makes it an adventure.,Amy,8.0,1.0,The Locomotion Interruption
" That’s a good point. You know, I’m a lot like Gandalf the Grey. He fought the Balrog and emerged stronger than ever as Gandalf the White.

" This job is a lot like being a waitress, except instead of pushing the fish tacos ’cause they’re about to go bad, you’re just pushing our antidepressants before the FDA finds out they may cause rectal bleeding.",Bernadette,8.0,1.0,The Locomotion Interruption
 They do?,Penny,8.0,1.0,The Locomotion Interruption
" Maybe. But like our lawyers say, the world is full of things that can cause a rectum to bleed. Anyway, I talked you up to Dan. He’s the guy who’ll be interviewing you.",Bernadette,8.0,1.0,The Locomotion Interruption

 So do we. And I’ve seen you guys ignore each other for hours doing totally different things.,Leonard,8.0,3.0,The First Pitch Insufficiency

 There’s no way this is sixty feet.,Howard,8.0,3.0,The First Pitch Insufficiency
 That’s sixty feet.,Bernadette,8.0,3.0,The First Pitch Insufficiency
 Are you kidding me?!,Howard,8.0,3.0,The First Pitch Insufficiency
" Okay, stop.",Bernadette,8.0,3.0,The First Pitch Insufficiency
 Are you saying stop and we’re just too far away to hear you?,Howard,8.0,3.0,The First Pitch Insufficiency

 How about now?,Howard,8.0,3.0,The First Pitch Insufficiency
 Keep going.,Bernadette,8.0,3.0,The First Pitch Insufficiency
 Great. You take this and say when to stop. How much further?,Howard,8.0,3.0,The First Pitch Insufficiency

 Whatever. You can’t even go on a date without checking your relationship agreement.,Leonard,8.0,3.0,The First Pitch Insufficiency

 Not as well as we do.,Sheldon,8.0,3.0,The First Pitch Insufficiency

" Not according to the work of Berscheid, Snyder and Omoto.",Sheldon,8.0,3.0,The First Pitch Insufficiency
" Well, a relationship is more complicated than a French fry.",Penny,8.0,3.0,The First Pitch Insufficiency
" No, I’m not. French fries have three variables, crispiness, saltiness and shape. Which is why a curly fry only gets a two. If I wanted curls for dinner, I’d order a clown wig.",Sheldon,8.0,3.0,The First Pitch Insufficiency
" Sheldon, you’re just assigning random numbers to things based on your opinion.",Leonard,8.0,3.0,The First Pitch Insufficiency
 A hundred.,Penny,8.0,3.0,The First Pitch Insufficiency

" Everything is quantifiable. That French fry? A seven. Spider-Man? A nine. The number nine? Oddly, only a four.",Sheldon,8.0,3.0,The First Pitch Insufficiency
 I’m not jealous. I just think it’s silly for you to compare relationships like they’re something that can be quantified.,Leonard,8.0,3.0,The First Pitch Insufficiency
 It has avocado on it. She’s allergic to avocado. Are you so jealous of our relationship you want Amy to die?,Sheldon,8.0,3.0,The First Pitch Insufficiency
 Some perfect couple. He won’t even share his food with her.,Leonard,8.0,3.0,The First Pitch Insufficiency
 Absolutely not.,Sheldon,8.0,3.0,The First Pitch Insufficiency

 Sorry.,Leonard,8.0,3.0,The First Pitch Insufficiency

 Thanks. If we could get started. I’m a little busy.,Emily,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Oh, yeah, sure. Let me just get out my materials. Leonard gave me this briefcase. He used to carry it around in high school. You can still see the dent where they whacked him with it. Okay, I would like to talk to you about our new birth control pill, Femevra.",Penny,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 Great.,Emily,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" So, Femevra’s triphasic design provides balanced hormonal exposure.",Penny,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 All right.,Emily,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" It has also been shown to cause significantly fewer side effects than other oral contraceptives. Although it can cause acne, which, if you ask me, kind of increases its effectiveness as a contraceptive.",Penny,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 Funny.,Emily,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Okay, I’m sorry. Did we get off on the wrong foot? Because since the other night, I kind of feel like you might have a problem with me.",Penny,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration

" I miss Stuart’s place. All this loud music and exposed brick. What, is this a comic book store, or a rave at the third little pig’s house?",Sheldon,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Yep, I wish Stuart would reopen. I hate this place, too.",Howard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Okay, him I believe because he’s an 80-year-old man in a 15-year-old’s tee shirt. But you’re just upset about Stuart and your mom and all their HBOs.",Leonard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Yes, I am. You know, I can’t even watch Game of Thrones now without thinking of mother saying, Stuart, which one is Thrones?",Howard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" You know, he might not reopen. He didn’t get a lot of money from the insurance company.",Raj,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Well, I wouldn’t exactly call it a hook-up.",Penny,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration

" Oh, kids buy comic books. It would be great to figure out a way to get more kids in the store.",Leonard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration

 Sure.,Emily,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 And are you gonna use candy to lure them in?,Leonard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 We are now.,Raj,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 You told Emily we hooked up?,Penny,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Um, well, in my defence, I tell everybody.",Raj,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 Why would you say that?,Penny,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 We were having a conversation about past lovers.,Raj,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 We weren’t lovers. Come on. Everyone knows we didn’t sleep together. We got drunk and fooled around. Why couldn’t you just leave me out of it?,Penny,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Well, we were being honest. You would leave me out of the conversation with the next guy if you dumped Leonard?",Raj,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 Why say it?,Leonard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 Yes.,Penny,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Are you sure, because it doesn’t seem fine?",Penny,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Okay. If you really want to talk about this, I do have a problem.",Emily,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Oh, my God. Tell me, what did I do?",Penny,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Look, it’s nothing. It’s just, Raj told me that a while ago, you two hooked up.",Emily,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" What? Oh, why would he say that?",Penny,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 Did it not happen?,Emily,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 Penny’s apartment.,Scene,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration

 Hmm-hmm.,Amy,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 Almost everyone has a past.,Penny,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration

 It’s not.,Penny,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 And I’m sure you can turn it around.,Bernadette,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 How? You can’t force someone to like you.,Penny,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" What if you just hang around and act like her friend until you wear her down? I mean, next thing you know, you’re in her home, you’re eating her food, drinking her wine.",Amy,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" No, that won’t work.",Penny,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" You know, when I was a kid, I loved going there, but I could never get a ride.",Howard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Ooh, what if we got a van and drove around and picked kids up?",Raj,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Nice. You mean, like at parks and schools?",Sheldon,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Toy stores, puppet shows.",Howard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Hold on. So, your idea is to get a van and cruise the streets looking for kids to pick up?",Leonard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 Yes.,Sheldon,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" I’m gonna go with Penny on this one. Then again, why wouldn’t I? I mean, we go way back.",Amy,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration

 Capital Comics.,Scene,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" You know, the more I think about it, the more intrigued I am about having our own store.",Sheldon,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 We’ll get to see all the new stuff before it hits the shelves.,Howard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" And we’ll get to have fun interactions with our customers. Like, this isn’t a library, buy it or get out.",Sheldon,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 You say things like that all the time.,Howard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Yes, but as a store owner, I’ll finally have a good comeback to, You don’t work here, shut up.",Sheldon,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Uh, do you know how Penny told Raj he should have left her off his list?",Leonard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Well, I would never leave you off my list, and not just because, without you, we’re playing fast and loose with the word list.",Raj,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Well, good job. Now she hates me. Ugh.",Penny,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 Great.,Raj,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" On the bright side, that Oxford study was right. One friend down. I wonder who you’re going to lose next.",Sheldon,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" You, okay? It’s you. You’re, you’re next.",Raj,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 No. You’re crazy about me.,Sheldon,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 If only Penny had said that once in a while.,Sheldon,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Hey, what difference does it make? You’re the one she wants to marry.",Howard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 That’s true.,Leonard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Yeah, and I’m not sure that complete honesty is always the best thing for a relationship.",Howard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Yeah, he’s right. Once, in a moment of candour, I told Amy that her hair reminded me of a duck caught in an oil spill. She stormed out. Which was sad, because we were playing Scrabble, and I had all the letters to spell persimmon.",Sheldon,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 Why are you even part of this conversation? You don’t know anything about women.,Leonard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" I know that if I had a wife or a fiancée, I’d ask her first before I invested money in a comic book store.",Sheldon,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 He’s right.,Howard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Yeah, well, of course I am. I was also right about her hair. It did everything but quack.",Sheldon,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 The stairwell.,Scene,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 You’re right. Cheers.,Amy,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Oh, I know. Why don’t you use your sales training to go back down there and sell yourself?",Bernadette,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 What?,Penny,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Yeah. But instead of selling a drug, you’d be selling Penny. it’s cute.",Bernadette,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 It’s stupid.,Penny,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Well, maybe people would like you more if you didn’t crap all over their ideas.",Bernadette,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 Yeah.,Leonard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 Huh.,Penny,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration

 Nope.,Bernadette,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 But you didn’t hear what it was.,Howard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 I know.,Bernadette,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Oh, come on.",Howard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 Fine. What is it?,Bernadette,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 It’s to help reopen the comic book store.,Howard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 Yeah.,Howard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Well, do you think when she and I had that conversation, she left people off her list?",Leonard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 I’m sure she did.,Sheldon,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 Why?,Leonard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Because if she hadn’t, she’d still be wading through the list.",Sheldon,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 Will you stay out of this?,Leonard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Oh. Howie, I had no idea.",Bernadette,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Well, I don’t like to talk about it.",Howard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Oh, baby. That story’s made up, isn’t it?",Bernadette,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 That’s how much buying a comic book store means to me.,Howard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 The apartment.,Scene,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 I’d like your honest opinion on something.,Sheldon,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 Of course.,Amy,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Now, before I start, I need you to know that I’m very excited about this, and anything you say that isn’t enthusiastically supportive will throw our entire relationship into question. So, keep an open mind.",Sheldon,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" I’m feeling a little backed into a corner, Sheldon.",Amy,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration

" Mm, the guys and I were thinking about investing in Stuart’s comic book store. Is that okay?",Leonard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 Why are you asking me?,Penny,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Well, you know, we’re engaged, and it’s kind of a big deal financially. It seems like something we should talk about.",Leonard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Oh. Well, would you consider mounds of credit card debt kind of a big deal financially?",Penny,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 Hi.,Penny,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 Thanks for inviting us over.,Raj,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration

" No, no. No need to apologise.",Penny,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Excuse me, can I say something? I just love both you guys, and I want you to get along. And when I say love I meant as a friend. And, uh, way too soon, right?",Raj,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Okay, sit down. Listen, Emily, what happened between me and Raj was a long time ago.",Penny,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" It was, and I may have made it seem like a bigger deal than I should have.",Raj,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Yeah, and Leonard and I are engaged now, and I’m just hoping we can put this whole thing behind us.",Penny,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Mm. I’d like that, too. Yeah, I thought I’d be okay with it, but then I saw how pretty you are.",Emily,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 Nope.,Bernadette,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Well, hear me out.",Howard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Howard, you know we’re saving up for a house.",Bernadette,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" I know, but all the guys are doing it. We’re splitting it four ways, so it’s really not that much money.",Howard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 It just seems like a risky investment.,Bernadette,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" I get that. I, okay, look, the real reason this is important is, before my dad left me and my mom, he used to take me to the comic book store. It was one of the few things we did together.",Howard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 I’m always welcome.,Howard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Mm, just try and call first.",Stuart,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration

" Oh. I appreciate the offer, but actually your mother already gave me the money.",Stuart,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 What?,Howard,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Yeah. I told her it was too much, but she said she was happy to help out her bubala.",Stuart,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration

 I’m so glad we could work this all out.,Raj,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
" Interesting. Can you see how a grown man, an accomplished scientist, who invests in a store that sells picture books about flying men in colourful underwear might be wasting both his financial and intellectual resources?",Amy,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration
 No.,Sheldon,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration

" Oh, that’s so sweet. I mean, look at you, you are gorgeous.",Penny,8.0,4.0,The Hook-Up Reverbration

" Guys, in 30 seconds, we went from let’s change the world to let’s watch TV.",Leonard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 Cool. I’ll make the popcorn.,Raj,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" Yeah, I have it on Blu-ray. We should watch it.",Sheldon,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 No.,Penny,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 But they play Barry Manilow.,Amy,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 Nah.,Penny,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 Ooh. There’s a cover band in the lounge.,Amy,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" So, where should we go first?",Penny,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 A Vegas hotel room.,Scene,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 I’ll make the popcorn.,Raj,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 We got to watch Back to the Future II.,Howard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 I think I have the same one.,Sheldon,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" Oh, I have an idea.",Raj,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" Well, it’s, it’s possible at absolute zero, but we would have to remove the temperature restrictions.",Leonard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" If we could figure out the scientific basis for Marty’s hover board, that would have universal application.",Sheldon,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 How cool would that be if we could make one of those a reality?,Leonard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" Hey, the future they show in Back to the Future II is only a year away. A lot of the things in that movie haven’t been invented yet.",Raj,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" You know, a number of significant innovations have been inspired by science fiction. The, the geosynchronous satellite from Arthur C. Clarke. The Motorola flip phone, that came from Star Trek. And I’ve long suspected that the idea of an African-American president was stolen from the movie Deep Impact.",Sheldon,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" You know, let’s just come up with something new.",Leonard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 You sure?,Bernadette,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" Uh, it’s kind of a lot. You know, let me do a little tonight, and I’ll catch up with you guys later.",Penny,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 Can you start in the morning?,Amy,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 That sucks.,Bernadette,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" It means instead of having a week to study, I only have two days.",Penny,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 What does that mean?,Amy,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 It’s my boss. They moved my field ride up to Monday.,Penny,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 What?,Amy,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" Oh, you will. That’s why they give you the bucket. Uh-oh.",Penny,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 What if we don’t want to vomit?,Amy,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" Well, we’re in Vegas. I want to go downstairs, get a bucket of margaritas, dance until I vomit all over a roulette wheel and watch it go everywhere.",Penny,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" Well, what do you want to do?",Bernadette,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 No.,Penny,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 Great.,Amy,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 Oh. Okay.,Penny,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 But they’re called Fairly Manilow.,Amy,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" Unlike Hot Tub Time Machine, this couldn’t be more simple. When Biff gets the almanac in 1955, the alternate future he creates isn’t the one in which Marty and Doc Brown ever use the time machine to travel to 2015. Therefore, in the new timeline, Marty and Doc never brought the time machine…",Sheldon,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 What?,Howard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" Yeah, but he had will haven’t placed it!",Sheldon,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" Okay, so, it wasn’t until his 21st birthday that Biff had will have placed his first bet and made his millions. That’s when he altered the timeline.",Leonard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 That’s my boy.,Sheldon,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 Had will have placed?,Leonard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 Is placed the right tense for something that would have happened in the future of a past that was affected by something from the future?,Sheldon,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 What do you mean?,Leonard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" Wait. Whoa, whoa. Is placed right?",Sheldon,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" This is Hot Tub Time Machine all over again. If future Biff goes back to 2015 right after he gives young Biff the almanac, he could get back to the 2015 with Marty and Doc in it. Because it wasn’t until his 21st birthday that 1955 Biff placed his first bet.",Leoanard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" Hold on. Pause. Something doesn’t make sense. Look, in 2015, Biff steals the sports almanac and takes the time machine back to 1955, to give it to his younger self. But as soon as he does that, he changes the future, so the 2015 he returns to would be a different 2015, not the 2015 that Marty and Doc were in.",Howard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 The apartment. ,Scene,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 Okay.,Amy,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 We’re not seeing Fairly Manilow.,Bernadette,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" So, um, now that Penny’s not coming…",Amy,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" Yeah, it’s okay. Go ahead.",Penny,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 I’m proud of her. This is a great opportunity. It’s nice to see her take it seriously.,Bernadette,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" Look at us out, while Penny’s in the room studying.",Amy,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" I think after this, I’ll be dead.",Bernadette,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation

" Guys, what are we doing? We sent the girls away so we could focus.",Leonard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 Do you know if you look at Austria on a map it actually looks like a wiener?,Raj,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" Do you know that the word wiener comes from the German name of the Austrian capital Vienna, or Wien?",Sheldon,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 Guys.,Leonard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" Oh, that stuff is so good wrapped around cocktail weenies.",Howard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" He’s right. Also, what kind of name is Biff? Sounds like when you pop open a can of Pillsbury dough. Biff.",Raj,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" Oh, I’m going with it. Marty and Doc never had have had brought the time machine to 2015. That means 2015 Biff could also not had have had brought the almanac to 1955 Biff. Therefore, the timeline in which 1955 Biff gets the almanac is also the timeline in which 1955 Biff never gets the almanac. And not just never gets. Never have, never hasn’t, never had have hasn’t.",Sheldon,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 I don’t know. You did it to me.,Leonard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 Marty and Doc never had have had brought?,Sheldon,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 Wait. Is brought right?,Leonard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" Well, I wonder if anyone’s tried that.",Sheldon,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" Or if we could figure out a way to supercool the materials, we could utilize quantum coupling.",Howard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" So, I’ve been thinking about the hover boards, and maybe there’s a way we could use Maglev technology.",Leonard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" Plus, this is where our minds are conditioned to focus on work.",Raj,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation

" Oh, don’t be embarrassed. I’ll show you the divot in my spine.",Amy,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 You’re embarrassing me.,Bernadette,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation

" Better than good. I mean, look at you. Your body’s bangin’.",Amy,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation

" Oh, I’ll check Amazon.",Sheldon,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 If only we had one.,Leonard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" Mmm, not bad. You know, in medieval times, idle chatter was punished with a device called the scold’s bridle. It’s an iron cage that’s locked around the head and pierces the tongue.",Sheldon,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 We could snap a rubber band on our wrists every time we get sidetracked.,Howard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 Not getting to see who wins at pigeon ping-pong comes to mind.,Raj,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 Some psychologists perform operant conditioning with punishment. Maybe we can come up with a punishment for straying off topic.,Leonard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" Hey, it was match point.",Raj,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 That cannot be true.,Raj,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" Yeah, exactly. Did you know those techniques were used to actually teach pigeons to play ping-pong?",Sheldon,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 Like behavior modification?,Howard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" Yeah, he’s right. Oh, here’s a thought. What if we use some form of operant conditioning techniques to keep us from getting off topic?",Sheldon,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 I’m sure Mrs. Florida’s walking funny. Can we get back to work?,Leonard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" That’s nothing, dude. Go check out how hung Florida is.",Raj,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" Oh, I can’t argue with him. It’s right there on the screen. Austria does look like a wiener.",Howard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 Go online and look it up.,Raj,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 Can you believe this nerd?,Amy,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 That sounds so great. But I have a little more studying to do.,Penny,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 We want to see if they twirl their junk in the other direction.,Bernadette,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" Hey, Penny, hey, let’s go. We found a place that has Australian male strippers.",Amy,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 Then guess who wildly overtipped a cocktail waitress.,Bernadette,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 That’s a dollar.,Penny,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 Guess who won a hundred dollars playing craps.,Bernadette,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation

 Why’d you tell her? It was working.,Amy,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation

 Thank you. And now I owe you one.,Leonard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" That’s ridiculous. Sheldon, I vote that is not a tangent.",Howard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 You said quantum coupling. That made me think of the show Quantum Leap. That’s a tangent and it’s your fault.,Sheldon,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" We didn’t have to, that was clearly a tangent. Now come on. Back to work. If we’re leaning towards quantum coupling… Aah! Why?",Leonard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 Ow. We didn’t vote!,Sheldon,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" I think it’ll be pretty clear. If not, we’ll take a vote. Oh, and also…",Leonard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" Wait, a question, who decides if someone’s gone off topic?",Sheldon,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" All right, now, one benefit of quantum coupling…",Leonard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 And I really can’t let that happen or the girl who does my eyebrows will think I’ve been cheating on her.,Raj,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation

" All right, guys, look, I would love to go out, but I’ve got to get this done, okay? So have fun at the club. And if you get in trouble, find a policeman. And if he’s taking off his pants, he is not a real policeman.",Penny,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" Come on, do you want to sit here being a loser, or do you want to watch me climb into an Australian man’s G-string like a baby kangaroo?",Bernadette,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 It’s late. We’ve wasted hours. Can we please find it in ourselves to do any amount of work tonight?,Leonard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" Yeah, sorry for clicking on that.",Raj,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation

 No way. Not Bill Murray.,Raj,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
" Oh, it’s used incorrectly all the time. Even Bill Murray makes that mistake in the first scene of Ghostbusters.",Sheldon,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 Negative reinforcement is really wrong?,Howard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 I think you mean positive punishment. Negative reinforcement is the removal of a positive stimulus. It’s a common mistake.,Sheldon,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation
 Everyone stop. This was a stupid idea. Negative reinforcement isn’t working.,Leonard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation

 Fine. Then we’ll just stay here and do it.,Leonard,8.0,5.0,The Focus Attenuation

" And I really appreciate it, but now I don’t need it, so here you go.",Penny,8.0,6.0,The Expedition Approximation
" Well, this is silly, so you don’t need the car, but you could use it to buy yourself something else, like a new purse to put all this money in.",Leonard,8.0,6.0,The Expedition Approximation
" Sweetie, I can buy my own stuff. I have a good job now.",Penny,8.0,6.0,The Expedition Approximation

 What?,Leonard,8.0,6.0,The Expedition Approximation
" Well, I just think that maybe you’re a little hung up on the money because I’m less reliant on you now, and that’s a little scary.",Penny,8.0,6.0,The Expedition Approximation
 Hmm. Maybe. Or maybe I tried to do something nice and maybe you had a problem with it because of your control issues.,Leonard,8.0,6.0,The Expedition Approximation

 No. They forgot I was there. But it really opened up my pores.,Amy,8.0,6.0,The Expedition Approximation

" Oh, she did. Seductively, like this. And then she touched my arm for two Mississippis. Like, you know, one Mississippi, two…",Man,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" I got it, I got it. Listen, um, I think there’s been a misunderstanding. See, Penny is my fiancée.",Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Really? I’ve never seen her wear an engagement ring.,Man,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Really?,Raj,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" So, am I to presume that her flirtation was just a sales technique?",Man,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Thank you.,Flowers,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" No, thank you. Delivery men are the unsung foot soldiers of our nation’s commerce. It’s because of people like you, people like me can limit our human contact. I’d shake your hand, but, well, you know.",Sheldon,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" I’m not a delivery man, I’m a doctor. Although I do often deliver alarming biopsy results to my patients.",Man,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 That’s humorous.,Sheldon,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Thank you. Sorry.,Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Oh, uh, you probably don’t want her to see this. It’s unnecessarily graphic.",Man,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Hold on, Doctor. Leonard, where are your social skills? This man is clearly upset. We should invite him in for a hot beverage.",Sheldon,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 He tried to score with Penny.,Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" So have these two, and they’re having dinner with us.",Sheldon,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 A bar.,Scene,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" So, how was work today?",Amy,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" It was fine, but you’ll be happy to know they pulled the sexy scientists article.",Bernadette,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 What happened?,Amy,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 I don’t know. They just canceled the photo shoot and said they’re rethinking it.,Bernadette,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Well, I’m really sorry, but I think it’s for the best. You want people focusing on your achievements, not staring at your breasts in some magazine.",Amy,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" I guess. It’s really not that important. Hey, up here.",Bernadette,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Yes.,Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Uh, extra peanut sauce?",Sheldon,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" No, but you can have mine.",Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Eh, well, very well. Oh, and on the topic of sharing things that are yours, there is a gentleman caller bringing flowers to your fiancée as we speak.",Sheldon,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" I simply pointed out that they would never consider doing an article ranking male scientists on their sexuality, let alone showing them in various stages of undress.",Amy,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Because no one wants to see Neil deGrasse Tyson in a wet T-shirt, bent over the hood of a Porsche.",Bernadette,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Well, it doesn’t make a difference, because they agreed it was in bad taste, and now you agree, so Amy saves the day.",Amy,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" No, what happened was you got jealous, so you took away a chance for me to get some publicity.",Bernadette,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 But it was bad publicity.,Amy,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" That’s for me to decide, not you.",Bernadette,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" I disagree. As a female scientist, I think what you do affects all of us.",Amy,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" And I think you don’t like people expressing their sexuality because no one wants you to express yours. Oh, Amy, I’m so sorry. That was over the line.",Bernadette,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 You have a nice night.,Amy,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Please don’t go. Up until my vicious attack, you were the one in the wrong.",Bernadette,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 The apartment.,Scene,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Here you go, Doctor. Red Zinger with one teaspoon of honey.",Sheldon,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 I think so.,Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 When will I learn? It’s just like the cute girl at the pet store all over again.,Man,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Excuse me?,Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Oh, uh, she touched my arm for five Mississippis, and I bought a two thousand dollar iguana habitat. Which she was always too busy to come over and see. You give these to Penny. You’re a, you’re a lucky man.",Man,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Wait a minute. You’ve snipped Gene Roddenberry’s vas deferens?,Sehldon,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Yes.,Man,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Wow, he really went where no man has gone before.",Howard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" I don’t like to brag,but, uh, you see, I’m kind of the doctor to the stars’ urinary tracts.",Man,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Wow.,All,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Uh, you, you want to see James Cameron’s kidney stone?",Man,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Ooh.,All,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" He was so happy after he passed it, he gave me a Terminator.",Man,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 That is amazing. How long have you been collecting?,Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Ever since I was a kid, but, uh, I didn’t really get serious until William Shatner’s bladder infection.",Man,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 What’d you get? What’d you get?,Sheldon,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Well, he said it was a tribble. It could be a toupee, but either way, it’s pretty cool.",Man,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Sorry, it’s just we’re, we were talking about them. So, look, I, I wasn’t going to say anything, but since you seem to be okay with the article being canceled, I have a little confession. I’m the reason it was pulled.",Amy,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 What? How?,Bernadette,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 I sent the editors of the magazine a pretty scathing e-mail.,Amy,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Amy, what did you say?",Bernadette,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Can I ask you a personal question?,Man,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Sure.,Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Um, I mean, you’re a guy like me, so how’d you get a girl like Penny?",Man,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Oh. Well, you know, just being myself, really.",Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Oh, please, you know, I’ll tell you how he did it. Implacable, relentless badgering. In urology terms, he was a drug-resistant staph infection. And she was a urethra that could not shake him.",Sheldon,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 I don’t know that I’d call myself an infection.,Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 A gallant man would defend his fiancée for being called a urethra.,Howard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Can we please change the subject?,Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Hi.,Penny,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Well, that didn’t go your way.",Raj,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Dr. Lorvis, what are you doing here?",Penny,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Uh, well, actually I came to see you.",Lorvis,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Thank you. Neat Star Trek mug. I actually have one of the phasers from the original TV show.,Man,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Oh, cool.",Raj,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 How’d you get that?,Howard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Oh, easy, Gene Roddenberry needed a vasectomy.",Man,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 You touched my arm for two Mississippis.,Lorvis,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Oh. That’s why you were mumbling Mississippi.,Penny,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Can we talk in private?,Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Please, yes.",Penny,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 I’ll be right back.,Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 So what other celebrity genitalia have you handled?,Sheldon,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" So, uh, what’s the deal? You take off your ring when you go to work?",Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" What? No, no, I just put it on the other hand and turn it around. Keep that hand in my pocket.",Penny,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Why?,Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Well, what do you mean why? Look, I make more sales if these doctors think I’m single. I did the same kind of thing as a waitress. The real question is, what is he doing in your apartment?",Penny,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Oh, he was upset. So Sheldon invited him in for a hot beverage.",Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 You were okay with that?,Penny,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 I would love to see your collection.,Raj,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Anytime. Uh, I’ve got some cool stuff. When I first started, I thought it would be a good way to meet women, but, well, you know.",Man,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 We know.,Howard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Preach.,Raj,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Why am I the one that has to get rid of him?,Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" I can’t do it, he’s my best client.",Penny,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" All right, I’ll get rid of him. But you owe me one.",Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Hey, we’re going to Oliver’s house to see his collection. You want to go with us?",Raj,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Yeah, sure. You owe me.",Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Dr Lorvis’ basement.,Scene,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Oh, my God.",Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Leonard, I was wrong. Heaven does exist. And it’s in the basement of a urologist’s house in Sherman Oaks.",Sheldon,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Welcome to my Fortress of Solitude. This is where I go to get away from all my other solitude.,Lorvis,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Oh, come on. It’s a replica.",Howard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Original.,Lorvis,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Oh, I think I just cheated on my wife.",Howard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Really? Why?,Penny,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Ah, that’s a good question. Apparently someone was being awfully flirty while not wearing their engagement ring, causing another someone to show up here thinking the first someone might be available.",Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Oh, God. Don’t make it so hard on her. Look, the first someone is the deceitful you. The second someone is the delightful Dr. Lorvis.",Sheldon,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Oh, this is very embarrassing. Dr. Lorvis, I am so sorry. I did not mean to lead you on.",Penny,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Oh, I was hoping for a juicy tidbit about Ron Perlman’s testicles.",Raj,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Oliver, I’m going to play bingo.",(off),8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Okay, Mother. Have fun.",Lorvis,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Still lives with his ma. Yikes, right?",Howard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Yeah, I’m not quite sure how to respond.",Raj,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Wow, Donkey Kong. This, this was my game when I was a kid.",Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Because it’s a story of a pretty blonde girl tirelessly pursued by a small, oddly-shaped man?",Sheldon,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" No, because I liked it.",Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Well, now, don’t get defensive. You’re oddly-shaped, but you got the girl.",Sheldon,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" So, I’ve noticed Leonard gets teased a lot 0about his relationship with Penny.",Lorvis,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Yes. If you’d like to join in, the premise is their love seems unlikely and doomed to failure.",Sheldon,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" So, you think she’ll be single soon?",Lorvis,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" No. I got upset. And Sheldon made me a beverage, too.",Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Okay, he just showed up at my door. Don’t you think that’s a little weird?",Penny,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" A little, but he’s basically harmless. He’s actually kind of a nice guy.",Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Okay. Whatever, look, my company does not allow me to socialize with doctors outside of work. You got to get rid of him.",Penny,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 I’m still upset about that peanut sauce.,Sheldon,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 The lobby.,Scene,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Oh, could you hold the door?",Lorvis,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Nice flowers.,Amy,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Thank you. They’re for a girl. Uh, I’m being implacable and relentless.",Lorvis,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Isn’t she lucky?,Amy,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 She keeps sending me mixed signals. But I think we both want the same thing.,Lorvis,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 What’s that?,Amy,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Unconditional love.,Lorvis,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 I guess that’s all anybody wants.,Amy,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 I guess so.,Lorvis,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Well, I hope you get it.",Amy,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 The gun from Hellboy?,Raj,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Yup.,Lorvis,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 How did you get it?,Raj,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation

 But what about the other girl?,Amy,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Oh, right. I’ll tell her we should just be friends.",Lorvis,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation

 You think he bites?,Raj,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Stick your head in there and find out.,Howard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 You fooled me with that goat at the petting zoo. You will not fool me again.,Raj,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 I wonder where Dr. Lorvis is. He’s been gone a while.,Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Oh, if you want to get in on the pool, you’re too late. All the squares have been purchased.",Sheldon,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Interesting. Excuse me, I have to take care of something.",Lorvis,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Leonard, as your friend I feel I should tell you something.",Sheldon,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 What?,Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Oh, this day just keeps getting better.",Sheldon,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Penny’s apartment.,Scene,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" So, you just left them alone playing games in your house?",Penny,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Well, they seemed happy and I thought that would give me time for you and I to get to know each other better. That was before we met.",Lorvis,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 We all have a past.,Amy,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Doc, you’ve got to see what you’re doing is, is a little creepy.",Penny,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 You sound just like Sigourney Weaver when I followed her into a restroom.,Lorvis,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Okay, you can’t just go chasing after every girl who’s nice to you.",Penny,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Well, that’s not what Sheldon says. And he seems to know his way around the ladies.",Lorvis,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Hey, Leonard. Guess who’s back. Dr. Lorvis. Yeah. You care to join us? What? You locked them in your basement?",phone),8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation

 She seems nice. Who’s she?,Lorvis,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation

 Oh-hom yeah.,Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Yes.,Howard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Next level.,Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Maybe he’s playing bingo with his mommy.,Raj,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 It’s sad how some guys can’t cut the apron strings.,Howard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Okay, now you’re messing with me.",Raj,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation

 Yeah.,Penny,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation

" Three Mississippi, four Mississippi.",Lorvis,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Move it.,Penny,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" He was being funny. I’m pretty sure. Anyway, I was asked to be a part of a magazine article about the 50 sexiest female scientists in California. Isn’t that cool?",Bernadette,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 I think it’s awful.,Amy,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Why would you say that?,Penny,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Leonard, are you okay?",Penny,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Better than okay. I am having the game of my life.,Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation

 Yes. I’m very sorry for locking you in my home.,Lorvis,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Are you bringing flowers to a patient to cushion the blow of a terminal diagnosis? That wasn’t a joke.,Sheldon,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 All right. These are actually for a nice woman who makes sales calls to my office.,Man,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Hmm. You know, they have delivery people that will do that for you.",Sheldon,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 I was hoping to impress her by tracking her down on the Internet and then showing up unannounced at her door.,Man,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Making the extra effort. Good for you.,Sheldon,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation

 What would a one-celled organism have to be embarrassed about?,Bernadette,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Same as all of us, getting out of a car without underwear.",Penny,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Speaking of underwear, I have some interesting news.",Bermadette,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation

 What? Why didn’t you say that first?,Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Why didn’t you get extra peanut sauce? We can both play this game.,Sheldon,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Can I help you?,Leonard,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Bernadette is a successful microbiologist. She should be celebrated for her achievements, not her looks. I mean, what kind of message does that send?",Amy,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 I think the message is check out the rack on that scientist.,Penny,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 Why can’t someone be thought of as both smart and pretty?,Bernadette,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
 I just don’t think a professional woman should have to flaunt her sexuality in order to get ahead.,Amy,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Okay, what’s the big deal? Look, if it helps me make a sale with a physician, I don’t think it hurts to flirt a little. I mean, laugh at their joke, touch their arm, maybe crank up the AC in the car beforehand, you know, to wake up the girls.",Penny,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" Maybe it’s different in the world of sales, but it’s already hard enough for women to be taken seriously in science.",Amy,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation
" I was kind of excited about the article, but now you’re making me feel bad.",Bernadette,8.0,7.0,The Misinterpretation Agitation

" I meant why are they folded? But whatever. Ooh, what’s this?",Amy,8.0,8.0,The Prom Equivalency
" No. I had a date with a proper education. Instead of a tuxedo, I dressed myself in good habits. Instead of spiked punch, I enjoyed the intoxicating flavour of knowledge. Instead of dancing in a gym, I shook my bootyto the seductive rhythms…",Sheldon,8.0,8.0,The Prom Equivalency
 Did you go to your prom?,Raj,8.0,8.0,The Prom Equivalency

" We pretend we’re aliens. I’m not the best at reading facial cues, but I’m gonna say that you love it and want to hear more. Now, in the beloved novel Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, an alien named Ford Prefect pretended to be human in order to blend in so that he could write an entry about Earth for The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, which is a travel book within the actual book, which is also called The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.",Sheldon,8.0,8.0,The Prom Equivalency

 There’s no denying I have feelings for you that can’t be explained in any other way. I briefly considered that I had a brain parasite. But that seems even more farfetched.

" It’s a shame they spent all that time unhappy. But sometimes, there’s muffin you can do about it. You get it, right?",Bernadette,8.0,9.0,The Septum Deviation
 I’m not answering that. It’s a trap.,Howard,8.0,9.0,The Septum Deviation
 So there are things you don’t like.,Bernadette,8.0,9.0,The Septum Deviation

" Well, is there anything about me you’re keeping inside?",Bernadette,8.0,9.0,The Septum Deviation
" Sheldon, I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about the surgery, but you were worried about nothing.",Leonard,8.0,9.0,The Septum Deviation
" Oh, you’re hardly out of the woods, no. You still run the risk of infection, a blood clot, the possibility that an inattentive surgeon let a barn spider lay eggs in your nose. The minute you sneeze web, I’m moving out.",Sheldon,8.0,9.0,The Septum Deviation
 And here I am in the trap. You just keep talking. I’m gonna chew my leg off.,Howard,8.0,9.0,The Septum Deviation

 All the time.,Sheldon,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
" On Earth? In our lives? That, that, that we’re living?",Leonard,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
" Okay. If I make this shot in the trash can, the probe will have arrived in perfect working order.",Raj,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration

 Yes.,Raj,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
 The man who crashed his stationary bike.,Howard,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
" I didn’t crash it, okay? My playlist was too up-tempo, I got light-headed and I fell off. Okay. It all comes down to this.",Raj,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
 You happy? Now you can relax.,Howard,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
 What kind of scientist are you? Everyone knows you got to make two out of three.,Raj,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
 A clothes shop.,Scene,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration

 You guys comfy? This might take a while.,Amy,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
 I don’t understand why women insist on making a big production out of buying clothes.,Sheldon,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
" Dude, that movie’s an imperialist fantasy that makes the followers of a beautiful and peaceful religion look like a bunch of bloodthirsty barbarians.",Raj,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
 You love that movie.,Howard,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
" Yeah, it’s pretty great.",Raj,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
 I’m surprised to see you suddenly get religious.,Howard,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration

 I’ll look them up. Son of a biscuit.,Sheldon,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
" Sheldon, it’s fine.",Leonard,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration

 Sure.,Amy,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
" Oh, yes. I, just yesterday, you had a, a big piece of lettuce stuck in your teeth at lunch. Did I say anything? No. I compromised and kept my mouth shut. Like you should’ve, because everyone was laughing at you.",Sheldon,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
 That is not a compromise. A compromise is me driving you everywhere because you refuse to learn how.,Leonard,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
" Oh, I learned how. Amy taught me.",Sheldon,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
 What? Then. then why don’t you do it?,Leonard,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
" Uh, well, it’s scary. And sometimes I get the pedals mixed up. But, more importantly, driving me to work is one of the things that gives your life purpose.

" If it’s okay with you, I’d like to go to temple.",Raj,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
" Buddy, trust me, you don’t want to convert to Judaism. I mean, I know I make it look cool, but it’s not all briskets and dreidels.",Howard,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
 I meant a Hindu temple.,Raj,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration

" Sheldon, do you realize I don’t live with the woman I love because of you? No other reason. Just you.",Leonard,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
 Why?,Raj,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
" Well, because I’ve known you for ten years and you’ve never gone to temple, you never talked about believing in God, and last Diwali I watched you eat two pounds of sacred cow at a Brazilian steak house.",Howard,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
" Religion is a very personal thing. I do go to temple, I just, I don’t talk about it.",Raj,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
" Yeah, but you’re a scientist.",Howard,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
 So?,Raj,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
" So, as a scientist, you believe the way to understand the universe is through facts and evidence, and now you’re counting on some blue chick with a hundred arms to help you?",Howard,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
 That is so offensive. Does everything you know about Hinduism come from Indiana Jones?,Raj,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
 No. There’s also Apu from The Simpsons.,Howard,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
" Well, lots of scientists believe in God. Okay? Newton, uh, Faraday, uh, Pascal, all were believers. Even Einstein was famous for attacking quantum theory on the grounds that God does not play dice with the universe.",Raj,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
" Well, of course he believed in God. he slept with Marilyn Monroe.",Howard,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration

 How is it okay?,Penny,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
" I promised myself, if I ever got friends, I’d do whatever they said. Really, I’m lucky you found me before a cult did.",Amy,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
" Well, you know, that was a long time ago. You’re a different woman now. You’re smart, you’ve got great friends, you’ve got a boyfriend, you’re pretty, you have zero fashion sense, but, anyway, tonight we’re gonna do whatever you want.",Penny,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration

 Huh. I always thought it was mini golf.,Howard,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
 Is that true?,Sheldon,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
" Yes, it’s true. The last time I brought it up, you had an emotional breakdown and got on a train and ran away.",Leonard,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
" Well, given my history on the subject, t seems a little reckless to bring it up now.",Sheldon,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
 You have no idea how much you inconvenience the lives of everyone around you. It’s exhausting.,Leonard,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
" You know what? You think you’re so tolerant, but the truth is you’re mean to me a lot. Yeah, you think that I don’t notice all those sarcastic comments and those eye rolls, but I do. Hmm? I have excellent peripheral vision. On a good day, I can see my ears.",Sheldon,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
" Sheldon, I, I’m sorry if I hurt your feelings. I’ve been holding a lot of this in for a while.",Leonard,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration

 All right. How about we start with two nights a week I live with Penny?,Leonard,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration

 All right. Shall we?,Raj,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
" Yeah. Just, uh, is there anything I should know before I go in?",Howard,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
 Like what?,Raj,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration
 Like am I dressed okay?,Howard,8.0,12.0,The Space Probe Disintegration

 Hold on. What’s in it for us?,Howard,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" According to a classic psychological experiment by Yerkes and Dodson, in order to maximize performance, one must create a state of productive anxiety.

 What do you mean?,Howard,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation

 Because you’re happy they’re elevated.,Amy,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" Really? Oh, that’s fantastic. Now, wait, they’re dropping. Why are they dropping?",Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" Look, your anxiety levels are right in the zone.",Amy,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" It’s called Emily or Cinnamon. I give you actual quotes I’ve heard Raj say, and you guess if he was talking to his girlfriend or his dog.",Howard,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" And if you only do solid research instead of making a groundbreaking discovery, what does it matter?",Amy,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
 Thank you.,Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" Sheldon, you’re a remarkable scientist. Just be patient, I’m sure you’ll find the breakthrough you’ve been looking for.",Amy,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
 Perhaps this was a waste of time.,Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
 My mother said that’s how good girls do it.,Amy,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
 Who eats them horizontally?,Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" Look, I know you don’t like it, but that’s the point of the experiment. I need to irritate you to find your optimal anxiety zone. And you said no to tickling, polka music or watching me eat a banana.",Amy,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" I’m sorry, I was aiming for your heart.",Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
 Ready? Begin. Why’d you pop it?,Amy,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" Very well. And good luck, I’m a pretty laid-back guy.",Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" All right, next, we’re gonna introduce an anxiety-inducing stimulus, measure your stress levels and see how it affects your problem-solving rate.",Amy,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
 I don’t think that’s what you want at all.,Raj,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" Stop fighting me on the premise. It’s scientifically valid. I’m going to advance propositions, I just want you to challenge me.",Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" Howard’s right, that’ll never work.",Leonard,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" Oh, no, it will. See, by keeping my mind engaged, I’ll become more focused.",Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
 Done.,Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
 Yes.,Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
 And you think that’s going to help?,Raj,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
 Yes.,Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
 So you just want us to disagree with whatever you say?,Leonard,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" Gentlemen, I have figured out the perfect way for you to irritate me. I’d like you to be my intellectual sparring partners. From now on, when I make an assertion, I need you to challenge it.",Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" That is a tough one. Uh, I know he brushes both of them.",Leonard,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" Oh, maybe I am. Who wouldn’t want to be the girl, or possibly dog, to hear the words you’re so lucky, you have the shiniest hair.",Howard,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" You know what? I think it’s a little weird that you remember me saying all these things. Maybe the truth is, you’re jealous of all my relationships.",Raj,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation

 Really? Want to go to Hawaii?,Penny,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" Only do solid research? I come to you for help, and you insult me? I thought the least that you would do would be…",Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" Yeah, clearly you haven’t seen him on the beach walking around with his metal detector.",Penny,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
 That would be so romantic for you and Leonard.,Amy,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation

" Yeah, well, then do it.",Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" Yes, we can.",Howard,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" I ask you for one simple thing, and you can’t even do it.",Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" Because it is what you want, and it’s not what you said.",Leonard,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" Why, of course it’s what I want. Why would I say it’s what I want if it’s not what I want?",Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" Well, at least listen to it through headphones. I’m trying to sleep. Good night.",Leonard,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" Oh. Uh, I need to keep my anxiety at the right level, so I’m using Darth Vader, the Joker, and Godzilla’s roar to keep me in that sweet spot. Uh, I tried including Taylor Swift in the mix, but turns out I love her.",Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation

" No, hold on. All canines instinctively know how to swim. Why wouldn’t a werewolf have the same abilities?",Amy,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
 Let’s just talk about our periods.,Penny,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" You talk about if werewolves can swim? See, Leonard says yes, but I say it depends on if the human could swim before he was bitten. What do you think?",Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" Sheldon, we are just people. We talk about the same things you guys talk about.",Penny,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" And how difficult it is to do when she’s bloated, cranky and crampy? Continue.",Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
 We were talking about Penny’s job.,Bernadette,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" Well, conversations that you wouldn’t be comfortable having in front of the opposite sex. You know, who has the best cervix. Which sanitary napkin is all the rage right now. Men’s buttocks, and how you want to pat and squeeze them.",Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
 What exactly do you think goes on here?,Penny,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" Well, as you may know, I’ve been experimenting with elevated anxiety levels, and I thought, what better way to increase my discomfort than to subject myself to an evening of tasteless uncensored crotch talk?",Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
 What’s up?,Penny,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
 It’s just so perfect that we’re both Libras.,Howard,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation

" Sheldon. Sheldon, I’m worried about you. You’re not eating, you haven’t slept in days, and, to be honest, that cap is starting to smell.",Amy,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" Oh, you said it.",Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
 Fine. How was your day?,Amy,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
 I can do both. My brain is working at optimal capacity. I can have a conversation with you and solve the dark matter proton decay problem at the same time.,Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
 Maybe you want to put the notebook away and talk to me.,Amy,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
 Yeah.,Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation

 Don’t you think you should make him stop all this?,Bernadette,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" Thank you. Oh, and technically, it’s apples that turn into were-oranges when the moon is full. Hey, this is fun. We should do it sometime when you aren’t all PMS’ing. Bye.",Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
 What happened?,Bernadette,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation

 Emily’s feelings?,Bernadette,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation

 Come on.,Raj,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
 Yes.,Penny,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation

" Wow, this is hard. I’m gonna say Cinnamon.",Penny,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" Your thoughts and ideas come from you, not from your anxiety.",Amy,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" Amy, I have gotten more done in the last few days than I have since I made the switch to dark matter. What if I stop doing this, and it all goes away?",Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" Sheldon, this has to stop. You need to get some sleep and take care of yourself.",Amy,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" Yeah, well, maybe it is, maybe it isn’t. I have been hallucinating lately.",Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
 I know. It’s replaced Godzilla as my principle source of anxiety.,Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" Or do I, hmm? Sir Isaac Newton wrote his Principia while convinced he was an armadillo.",Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
 You don’t need to drive yourself crazy in order to be productive.,Amy,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation

" Sheldon, stop it, I’m not kidding. Take the cap off, and put the notebook away.",Amy,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" There you go, perfect.",Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" I’m sorry, but you know we agreed not to bring work to date night.",Amy,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" That nagging tone is helping my anxiety, yeah. But if you could maybe just go ten percent less shrill, that’d really put the zip-a-dee in my doo-dah.",Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation

 Amy’s apartment.,Scene,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation

 Maybe in the morning.,Leonard,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" No, no, comfort is the enemy. You know what’s comfortable? Slippers and blankets and panda bears. Imagine a panda bear with Richard Feynman’s face on it. Warm up the car, Leonard, it’s poster time.",Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation
" Now, you just get comfortable.",Penny,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation

" Well, I’ve been struggling for months to come up with a theory of dark matter that doesn’t make protons decay. I’m hoping to finally tackle it by optimising my work environment. See, I’ve got, uh, my tea is at the perfect sipping temperature. Uh, I have fleece-lined boxer shorts to keep my tushie toasty. And then, oh, last but not least, this inspirational cat poster improved with the reassuring face of physics renegade Richard Feynman.",Sheldon,8.0,13.0,The Anxiety Optimisation

" Well, I haven’t. And while they say never meet your heroes, I just don’t see how I could disappoint. Who would you choose?",Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 You sure that’s your choice? ‘Cause I’ve had that dinner.,Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Ah, that’s just as well. As much as I’d love to meet Euclid, inventor of the geometric proof, he probably wore sandals and I cannot look at toes during dinner. Oh, I know, the person I’d most like to have dinner with is myself.",Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Just says anyone in the world. I guess that means living.,Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Hmm. Living or dead?,Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Question one. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?",Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Well, as a Texas gentleman, I’m inclined to say ladies first. Although, I’m concerned that level of politeness and charm might make you fall in love with me before the test even begins. Perhaps we should flip a coin. Or if you’re familiar with the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors…",Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 I think we’re safe.,Amy,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Well, even if the study’s nonsense, I don’t believe in tempting fate. Same reason I wouldn’t use a Ouija board, or pick a fight with an Asian guy. He probably doesn’t know karate, but why risk it?",Raj,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Yup. Be right there. I assume you don’t want wine.,Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 You ready to begin?,Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Penny’s apartment.,Scene,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 The world’s greatest mom is in the shoe compartment.,Howard,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Um, well, it’s, uh, black. There’s a red ribbon tied to the handle.",Bernadette,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 And can you describe the bag?,Clerk,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" I don’t think so. Leonard can’t stand yoga, the beach, massages or dancing.",Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 He’s there.,Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 You didn’t mention Leonard.,Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Yeah, why?",Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 That’s it?,Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Uh, well, I’d probably sleep in, do a little yoga, then lie on the beach while cute cabana boys brought me drinks and probably get a massage and then cap off the night with some dancing.",Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 What would constitute a perfect day for you?,Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Penny’s apartment.,Scene,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Not much, but he seemed to be in a pretty good place.",Raj,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Did he say anything about the funeral?,Amy,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 What’s that?,Leonard,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Ooh, have you ever been to an escape room?",Emily,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Well, we’re the ones tagging along, you pick.",Amy,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" So, what do you guys want to do?",Raj,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Raj’s car.,Scene,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Oh, I didn’t think of Iron Man. You know, maybe after myself and I have dinner, we can meet you two for dessert.",Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Uuuuuuuh!,Zombie,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Uh, wasn’t there supposed to be a zombie?",Raj,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 We have to look for the clues hidden around the room.,Emily,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" So, how do we start?",Amy,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 This is cool.,Leonard,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Oh.,Amy,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Ah, what a room!",Emily,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Yup.,Leonard,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 What heavy machinery? Let’s just start.,Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Correct. You’re not supposed to drink alcohol when operating heavy machinery.,Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" You’re about to enter the lab of the late Dr. David Saltzberg. While conducting studies on slowing the aging process, there was a catastrophic accident and he died. Or did he?",coat,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 An escape room.,Scene,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Who do you think made the French toast with butter and syrup?,Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Interesting, you didn’t mention Amy.",Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Uh, I wake up. Uh, I enjoy some French toast with butter and syrup. Uh, then a wormhole opens, and whisks me millions of years into the future where my towering intellect is used to save the last remnants of mankind from a predatory alien race.",Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Yeah, well, he brought a book, okay? What’s yours?",Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Fine. Honestly, if I could have one quality, I wish I could be as smart as you guys.",Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 I believe what you’re doing is using humour to avoid vulnerability.,Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Come on, I’m just having some fun with you.",Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 I don’t think you’re taking this seriously.,Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Well, not to steal from the Bible, but turning water into wine sounds pretty good.",Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?",Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Penny’s apartment.,Scene,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" I’m sorry. W, would 500 frequent-flyer miles help? That could get you to Sacramento.",Clerk,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Oh, so kind of like what’s happening with Penny right now.",Raj,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Um, it’s kind of like interactive theatre, except you have to solve puzzles in a certain amount of time to get out. There’s one downtown where they trap you in a room with a zombie.",Emily,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" So, some stranger has my mom? Is that what you’re telling me? My poor mother can be anywhere in Los Angeles right now?",Howard,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" I don’t know, perhaps somebody took it off the carousel by mistake?",Clerk,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" So, where is it?",Bernadette,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Mr. and Mrs. Wolowitz? As far as I can tell, your bag arrived in Los Angeles.",Clerk,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 The Baggage Claim.,Scene,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Ooh. Okay, let’s hope one of the clues is written on a pair of clean underwear.",Raj,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Brains!,Zombie,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 The escape room.,Scene,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 And the wave is gone.,Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 You sure it’s not too much Bible juice?,Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Wow, I just felt this wave of affection for you.",Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Thank you.,Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Well, now I wish I had the ability to make that stuff easier for you.",Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Well, I’m not. And if I could read people’s minds, life would be so much simpler.",Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Are you being polite or scared?,Emily,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Ladies?,Leonard,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 You’re all alike.,Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 When are we going to get robot eyes?,Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Well, I can’t read people’s minds. Actually, that’s not true, I can read men’s minds, but only ’cause it’s usually the one thing.",Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" I’m sorry. That was me having fun with you. Look, you may not be as, as academically inclined as are we. Yes, that’s how you say it. But, you possess an intelligence I envy. Which leads me to my answer. I would choose the ability to read people’s minds.",Shedon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Sheldon.,Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Ha. Keep dreaming.,Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 There’s no way you could’ve known. Be right back. Excuse me?,Bernadette,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 The day she left for Florida. She asked me to drive her to the airport. I was too busy. And I made her take a cab. I was too busy.,Howard,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 What?,Bernadette,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 I could’ve driven her.,Howard,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" All right, we’ll wait.",Bernadette,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" No, I’m not leaving without her.",Howard,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Sure you don’t want to go home? When the bag’s returned, they’ll deliver it to us.",Bernadette,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 The baggage check.,Scene,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Oh, okay, great. So, your entire job is to find lost luggage, and you’ve narrowed down the location of my mother to the planet Earth.",Howard,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" I, I wish I was telling you that. Um, but the passenger could’ve gotten on an international flight.",Clerk,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Solve puzzle too fast! Slow down!,Zombie,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 I’m putting the city names in the grid now. I’m sure that’ll give us the code to the safe.,Leonard,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 We used the coordinates to locate the cities.,Amy,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 How’s it going with the globe?,Emily,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Okay, we’ve got the cipher decoded.",Raj,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Keep it down, we’re working here.",Amy,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" It’s like when you bought that remote-controlled helicopter, and it just flew away.",Raj,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 We spent two hundred dollars on six minutes of fun?,Leonard,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" So, that’s the key to the door? That’s it?",Amy,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Oh, got the key.",Emily,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Could be somewhere else.,Zombie,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 I bet the key’s behind it.,Leonard,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Ooh. There’s a picture of the sun over there.,Emily,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Well, if I don’t have a brother, my father’s son is me. And if I’m this man’s father, then he’s my son. The answer’s son.",Amy,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Really? You always seem so confident.,Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Well, what I meant was I often misinterpret how others are feeling. Like, I can’t always tell if someone is only joking or laughing at me. You know, like, uh, if they’re mad at something I’ve done or just in a bad mood. It, it’s incredibly stressful.",Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Here it is. There’s a black light.,Leonard,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Uh, Origin of Species.",Raj,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Which book are we looking for?,Leonard,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 The escape room.,Scene,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" You better find my husband’s mother ’cause one way or another, w e’re walking out of this airport with a dead woman.",Bernadette,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Yes?,Clerk,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 You’re making it difficult to love you right now.,Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 That is so funny. I never would have pegged you for a Pisces.,Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Thank you.,Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Well, thank you for sharing it with me. I won’t tell anyone.",Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 The point of the experiment is to be completely honest with each other.,Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" So, why did you finally tell me?",Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Well, I don’t enjoy presents. And the thought of people jumping out and yelling surprise fills me with more dread than the words George Lucas Director’s Cut.",Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Well, that’s always been a secret. Not even Amy knows.",Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Just saying, no refund for finish early!",Zombie,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Yup. Got the code.,Leonard,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" So, it would be today? Huh. Well, I suppose there’s something satisfying about dying on my birthday.",Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone?",Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Penny’s apartment.,Scene,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Remember that before you post on Yelp.,Zombie,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Well, to be fair, we do all have advanced degrees.",Amy,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Sorry, guys. Really thought the puzzles would be better.",Emily,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 This is kind of creepy.,Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Sorry.,Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 We’re not supposed to talk during this part.,Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 And begin. This is kind of creepy.,Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Yes.,Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 You ready?,Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Okay. Wait, hang on. Bladder check. We’re good to go.",Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 All that’s left to do is stare into each other’s eyes for four minutes without talking.,Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Oh, okay. Uh, brothers and sisters I have none, but this man’s father is my father’s son. Who am I looking at? Yeah, yeah, we get it, you want brains. Calm down.",Raj,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Oh, hang on.",Emily,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Oh, no. That thing’s gonna end up in my bedroom.",Bernadette,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Ma? I’m sorry I didn’t take you to the airport. I just want you to know that I’ll never forgive myself for being so selfish. And I promise to keep you close for the rest of my life.,Howard,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Okay, thank you so much.",Bernadette,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Oh, thank God. It’s okay, she’s here. Ma’s here.",Howard,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Great news, your bag was returned.",Clerk,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 The baggage check.,Scene,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" No, it wasn’t. Uh, now let’s tabulate the results of the experiment. I think it’s safe to say that you’re not in love with me and I’m not in love with you. And psychology has once again proved itself the doofus of the sciences.",Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 That’s it. That wasn’t so bad.,Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" I remember it perfectly. But I have an eidetic memory. If you’re interested, I also remember how much you owe us for the food.",Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 I can’t remember a time you guys weren’t in my life.,Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Yeah, and you’re still eating our food.",Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Can you believe it’s been eight years?,Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 It was a Monday afternoon. You joined us for Indian food.,Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Just thinking about the day I met you and Leonard.,Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Yes.,Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Today’s your birthday?,Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Oh. Well, I suppose I do think of you as a sister. And sometimes, a mother.",Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 I meant more like a little brother.,Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Of course you are, I’m warm and soothing. I’m like a human bowl of tomato soup.",Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Aw, sweetie, I’m comfortable around you, too.",Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Well, you have a brown fleck in your right iris that looks like a Formula One race car. So I’m just concentrating on that. Plus, it’s easier around people that I’m comfortable with.",Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Do you want to stop? I know you have trouble with eye contact.,Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Aah! And after I let you be Gary.,Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 SURPRISE!,All,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 It really has.,Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 That’s it. We’re done with the questions.,Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Penny’s apartment.,Scene,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Well, this is me. It’s been a very interesting evening.",Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 I just want to make sure you get there safe.,Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Thank you for walking me home.,Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 The hallway.,Scene,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Gary Con, do we fly or drive? Do we wear costumes? And if so, who gets to be Gary?",Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 Like what?,Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" And I, you. And yes, that’s how you say that. Yeah, so, given our newfound intimacy, I’d say we have some hard choices to make.",Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Well, maybe. But I’m still glad we did it. I do feel closer to you.",Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 What?,Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 It’s getting creepy again.,Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 The apartment.,Scene,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 The hallway. ,Scene,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 In love yet?,Leonard,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Uh, fun fact, pontificate comes from the Latin word pontifex, which means bridge builder or Pope.",Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" That’s what I said. Before I knew it, he pontificated his way right into my heart.",Amy,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 I’m not gonna fall in love with Sheldon.,Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Yeah, but what if the experiment works?",Raj,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" I’ve been listening to Sheldon’s feelings on things for ten years. Tag, you’re it.",Leonard,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Please, can I do it with him? Please?",Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Yeah, but we don’t have to debate this. We’re scientists. We can conduct our own research. I propose that we imprison two street people and…",Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Oh, careful. You’re poking at the whole foundation of The Bachelor.",Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" I’m telling you, you can’t create love in a few hours. Right?",Leonard,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 What? I don’t need science to win her heart. I have my family’s wealth for that.,Raj,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Raj, would you ever try an experiment like that with Emily?",Penny,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Other than the fact that I had it, that was a magical night.",Amy,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
" Oh, that’s nonsense. I proclaimed my love for you. And the last time I looked into your eyes was when you thought you had conjunctivitis.",Sheldon,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 And then they finish it off by staring into each other’s eyes for four minutes.,Amy,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 That doesn’t sound right. My research has shown that it takes three to five years of shameless begging.,Leonard,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 I just read about an experiment designed to see if you could make two people fall in love in a matter of hours.,Amy,8.0,16.0,The Intimacy Acceleration
 You can’t be this proud.,Penny,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application

" Again, it was miniature golf.",Penny,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
" I was unstoppable. I mean, I was, I was on fire. It was like my mind and my body were totally connected, like, like athletes must feel when they’re in the zone.",Leonard,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
 Sarcasm?,Sheldon,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
" For Halloween, we can dress him as a cobblestone.",Amy,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
" Yeah. And if he ever goes berserk, I know I can outrun him. Coincidentally, that’s also why I chose you as a roommate.",Sheldon,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
" Well, congratulations. Who would’ve thought you two would be the first in our group to start a family?",Leonard,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
 Mm-hmm.,Penny,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
 That’s what I said.,Amy,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
 Emily’s apartment.,Scene,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
" So, where’s your roommate tonight?",Raj,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
" Well, I thought it was a little unfair that she’s always here, and you never get a chance to stay over, so I killed her.",Emily,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
 Why not?,Leonard,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
 Because I beat you.,Penny,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
 Hey.,Leonard,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
 Hi.,Penny,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
" Oh, good. You’re back.",Sheldon,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application

 A pet store.,Scene,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application

 It’s okay. You made it. We’re fine.,Amy,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
 That was a lot of puppies.,Sheldon,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
" Let’s forget about them, and pick ourselves out a nice turtle. Oh, how about this one up on the log?",Amy,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
" Oh, I don’t know. He kind of looks like a jerk. How about this one?",Sheldon,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
" Well, he’s barely moving. He looks half dead.",Amy,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
" I know. I like him, too. Hi, little guy. How’d you like to come home with us? You’ll be living with me because we don’t live in the same house.",Sheldon,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
 Yes.,Amy,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
" Okay. That was tricky, ’cause when it comes to alcohol, she generally means business.",Sheldon,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
" Well, we’re, we’re very happy for you.",Leonard,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
 Yes.,Penny,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
 Thank you. Acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us.,Amy,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
" No. It’s true. It means that we care so much about each other, there’s enough left over for an eight-ounce reptile.",Sheldon,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
 Why a turtle?,Leonard,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
" After much deliberation, we’ve determined that a turtle is the ideal pet. They don’t shed fur, they don’t make noise.",Sheldon,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
 The apartment.,Scene,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
" Hey, hey. Listen, I, I have a little confession to make.",Leonard,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
" Aw, is this your first time?",Penny,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
" No, I got you something for Valentine’s Day, and I was too embarrassed to give it to you.",Leonard,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
" Well, why?",Penny,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
" Well, ’cause I got it at the dirty store.",Leonard,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
 You went to the dirty store without me?,Penny,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
 In sunglasses and a hat after I parked two blocks away.,Leonard,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application
" But remember our agreement? You can joke about murdering people, but you have to say just kidding.",Raj,8.0,17.0,The Colonization Application

" Of course. I know what it’s like having to go through a loved one’s possessions. My uncle was a worshipper of Krishna. But after he died, you know what we found? A statue of Shiva. It may not be Crips and Bloods, okay? But in India, it’s a thing.",Raj,8.0,18.0,The Leftover Thermalization

" You know, you’re right. Yeah. You know, it’s like when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created Spider-Man. Stan Lee may get all the credit, but Steve Ditko knows he was just as important. Even though Stan Lee gets to be in all the Marvel movies. And. and he’s far richer. And he’s a household name, you know? Whereas, you know, you say Ditko, and that sounds like a company that makes Dits.",Sheldon,8.0,18.0,The Leftover Thermalization
" Uh, at least they’re talking about the theory. I mean, that’s what’s important.",Leonard,8.0,18.0,The Leftover Thermalization

 Thank you. What did he say?,Leonard,8.0,18.0,The Leftover Thermalization
 I did.,Sheldon,8.0,18.0,The Leftover Thermalization
 What happened? Did you tell him it was my idea?,Leonard,8.0,18.0,The Leftover Thermalization
 I spoke to the reporter at the magazine.,Sheldon,8.0,18.0,The Leftover Thermalization

" (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?",Sheldon,8.0,18.0,The Leftover Thermalization

 I am taking you shopping.,Penny,8.0,18.0,The Leftover Thermalization

" Oh, please. I have ideas all day long. Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people. A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge.

 Is it my fault that when the reporter cited me as the lead scientist I didn’t correct him?,Sheldon,8.0,18.0,The Leftover Thermalization
 Not your fault.,Amy,8.0,18.0,The Leftover Thermalization
 Does it have a camera in it?,Leonard,8.0,18.0,The Leftover Thermalization

" Indeed. Penny, a salon is a gathering where intellectuals entertained each other with sparkling conversations about issues of the day.",Sheldon,8.0,18.0,The Leftover Thermalization

" Good food, good friends, and sometime around midnight, heartburn that makes you pray for death.",Howard,8.0,18.0,The Leftover Thermalization
" Yeah, good for you, Leonard. That’s a lovely little notion. Kind of like, I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago. Yeah, now stand back while I invent the telephone. Hello? Oh, hold on. Leonard, it’s your uncle. He says you just got burned.",Sheldon,8.0,18.0,The Leftover Thermalization
" Oh, that’s fine.",Bernadette,8.0,18.0,The Leftover Thermalization
" Of course you’d focus on that rather than the inspiration. Uh, new salon topic. What’s more important, an idea or its execution?",Leonard,8.0,18.0,The Leftover Thermalization
 I don’t believe it matters what the topic is. What’s crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. It’s all about the execution.,Sheldon,8.0,18.0,The Leftover Thermalization
" Okay, new salon topic. Salons, dumb thing from a long time ago or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes? Discuss.",Penny,8.0,18.0,The Leftover Thermalization
 I wonder if only a baby who is worthy can suckle at the bosom of Thor.,Howard,8.0,18.0,The Leftover Thermalization

" Yeah, so are you.",Sheldon,8.0,18.0,The Leftover Thermalization
" So I heard you two, uh, wrote a paper together. How’s that going?",Stuart,8.0,18.0,The Leftover Thermalization
" Oh, maybe you’re right. He is kind of a lump.",Sheldon,8.0,18.0,The Leftover Thermalization
 He might not be.,Amy,8.0,18.0,The Leftover Thermalization
 Why? The theory he came up with just got mentioned in Scientific American. He ought to be thrilled.,Sheldon,8.0,18.0,The Leftover Thermalization
 Poor Leonard.,Amy,8.0,18.0,The Leftover Thermalization
 All I did was answer a few questions about the theory. And then expressed my gratitude that Scientific American doesn’t include any of those smelly perfume cards.,Sheldon,8.0,18.0,The Leftover Thermalization
 It only refers to Dr. Cooper and his team. Did you even talk about him?,Amy,8.0,18.0,The Leftover Thermalization
" Well, that can’t be right.",Sheldon,8.0,18.0,The Leftover Thermalization
" Sheldon, this article doesn’t mention Leonard at all.",Amy,8.0,18.0,The Leftover Thermalization

 I don’t hear it.,Amy,8.0,18.0,The Leftover Thermalization

 We haven’t been on a road trip in a while. This is fun.,Leonard,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
 It could be.,Leonard,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
 Let me ask you this. Do you think this song is the music the white boy ultimately plays?,Sheldon,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
 Sure.,Leonard,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
 And this music we’re listening to right now is funky as well?,Sheldon,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
 Yes.,Leonard,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion

" So it’s like the musical equivalent of Russell’s Paradox, the question of whether the set of all sets that don’t contain themselves as members contains itself?",Sheldon,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
" That’s not fair, she has upper body muscles.",Howard,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
" Yes, Penny plays for me.",Bernadette,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
" Bernadette, for every episode of Doctor Who Leonard has made me sit through, I will play on your behalf and send that TARDIS back to Gallifrey, where I hate that I know it belongs.",Penny,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
" Yes, but I mostly used it as a battlefield in an ongoing war between the Transformers and the ThunderCats for control of a bra I had found in the woods.",Howard,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
 How is that fair? You grew up with a table.,Bernadette,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
 I would do that.,Howard,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
 You could play Ping-Pong for it.,Raj,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
 That’s not fair. It’s like me challenging you to a sexy pants contest.,Howard,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
 You can’t just decide. How about I arm-wrestle you?,Bernadette,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
" We’re not selling it, it’s mine.",Howard,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
 Have you made a decision about the TARDIS? I think I can sell it if we call it Big British Porta-Potty.,Amy,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
 It’s tricky finding the right balance between tasteful modern and Jewish mother tchotchke crapfest.,Bernadette,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion

 Mrs Wolowitz’s house. ,Scene,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
 What are you talking about?,Sheldon,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
 Is that the attitude that helped you get Penny?,Sheldon,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
" Well, so do I, but they’ll never let us.",Leonard,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
 I want more than a picture. I want to go in.,Sheldon,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
 I know. You want to get a picture?,Leonard,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
 This is so amazing.,Sheldon,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
 Wasn’t even that hard to find.,Leonard,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion

" If you still have that bra, I’ll give you a nickel for it.",Amy,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
 So it’s settled. The fate of Doctor Who’s TARDIS will be decided by a Game of Thrones inspired death-match on the battlefield of ThunderCats versus Transformers.,Howard,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
" No, no, I like that show. It’s got dragons and people doing it.",Penny,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion

" Yeah, it’s also like when the Mountain fought the Red Viper in Game of Thrones.",Penny,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
" Ooh, you just chose champions. It’s like we’re re-enacting the ancient German practice of trial by combat.",Amy,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
" That’s right, okay, Raj can play for me.",Howard,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
" Dude, three-time Sanskriti School for Well-Born Boys badminton champion.",Raj,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
" Uh, I’m just gonna be honest with the guy.",Leonard,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
" I think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy, but one quest at a time. So what’s the plan?",Sheldon,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
" We’re trying to get past a security guard, not rescue Zelda.",Leonard,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion

 You’re blowing it. We want to meet George Lucas and become his friends and play with him.,Sheldon,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
" Um, uh, uh, uh, we don’t have an appointment, and, and we don’t belong here, but we, we’re, like, crazy-big fans.

 May I help you?,Voice,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
" You pushed it, are you out of your mind?",Sheldon,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
 Right.,Leonard,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion

" Okay, yeah. What do we have to lose? I’m a little nervous.",Leonard,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
" There’s a speaker box. Drive up, push the button, and let’s see what happens.",Sheldon,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
" No, but I don’t have three years to make that gate feel sorry for me.",Leonard,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
" I can see the ranch, Leonard. Oh, it’s rustic, it’s lovely. I’d take a picture, but people are chasing me. I’m gonna make it. I’m gonna make it. They have Tasers, but they wouldn’t dare use… Aaaaaaagh!",Sheldon,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion

" Hey, listen, you seem like decent guys. I can’t let you in, but I got some hats and T-shirts I can give you.",Guard,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion

 What if I told you that I was the voice of Yoda? A recording session I must attend.,Sheldon,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
" Sorry, guys, we get this a lot. Can’t let you in.",Guard,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
" We don’t have an appointment. We, we’re just fans of Mr. Lucas’s work, and we thought we’d take a shot and see if we could get in and look around.",Leonard,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
" Oh, you are killing me.",Sheldon,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
" Uh, I’m just gonna tell you the truth.",Leonard,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion

" Well, what’s your plan?",Leonard,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
 Honesty will never get us in.,Sheldon,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion

 She’s my champion.,Howard,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
 Wow.,Penny,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
" Uh, it, it’s been a long time. I don’t know. I’m probably pretty rusty.",Amy,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion

" I don’t know much about Doctor Who, but if, um, you were to put this right outside your front door and open up the back, it would be like your entire apartment was the inside of the TARDIS, which is pretty cool ’cause on the show, the inside of the TARDIS is bigger than the outside. But then again, I don’t know much about<i> Doctor Who.",Bernadette,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion

 But why are you here?,Sheldon,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
" Honestly, I just wanted to meet Mr. Lucas and say thank you. You know, growing up, the movies had such an impact on my life. I never really fit in anywhere. Till I discovered the worlds he created and finally found a place where I belong.",Guy,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
" So, what are you in for?",Sheldon,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
" Uh-huh, I’m normally very nice, but you shut up, too.",Leonard,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion

" Oh, shut up.",Leonard,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
" Oh, I think that’s below the pay grade of an Imperial Officer. Stormtroopers are really the ones who…",Sheldon,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
 I don’t know. Maybe they’ll call Imperial Officers to take us to a holding cell on the Death Star.,Leonard,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion

" Except, Raj is gonna win. Isn’t that right, Raj?",Bernadette,8.0,19.0,The Skywalker Incursion
" Okay, this is the match that decides it all. First to 11 wins. Serve switches every five points. And just so you know, when this started, I was going to put the TARDIS in a discreet corner of the house, but I’ve since turned mean, and now it’s going right in the middle of the living room on a rotating platform with a sign that says suck it.

" Well, it applies to you, too.",Amy,8.0,20.0,The Fortification Implementation
" I was afraid you might bring this up, so I have a work-around. There you go. As far as you’re concerned, I’m smiling. Although, I must admit, I’m smiling a little bit at the moment because this loophole is so brilliant.",Sheldon,8.0,20.0,The Fortification Implementation

" Yeah. I was at a science-fiction convention, and I saw a woman dressed as your half-ape character.",Wil,8.0,20.0,The Fortification Implementation
" Oh, if she was with an Indian guy dressed like a banana, that was just my friends, Howard and Raj.",Leonard,8.0,20.0,The Fortification Implementation
" All right, it’s time for a very special guest caller, a friend of mine, who you probably know as the director of such movies as Clerks, or from podcasts and books where he often reminds you that he’s the guy who directed Clerks. Hello, Kevin Smith.",Wil,8.0,20.0,The Fortification Implementation

 Hello.,Sheldon,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 You guys know the new Discovery class missions that NASA’s been working on?,Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 I don’t know. Should we call Sheldon and Howard?,Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 No. We can do this by ourselves.,Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 Okay. Great. How do you want to start?,Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" All right, you can’t breathe our air without an inhaler, he’s allergic to Earth nuts, but I’m the alien.",Sheldon,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration

 Are you kidding? Yes. What did you have in mind?,Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" I’ll tell you exactly what you should do, avoid the presumption of the Terran sensory input paradigm.",Sheldon,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Yeah, absolutely. You need a device capable of delivering information across a wide range of perceptual modalities.",Howard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 Any intelligent organism would at the very least need the ability to locate the position of objects in space. So the ideal interstellar lingua franca would be haptic.,Sheldon,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Ooh, how about a 3-D tactile communicator rigged for cross-sensory transposition?",Howard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Exactly what I expected. Two people forcing their ideas on me and only one gentleman who could be bothered to ask me what my thoughts were. You two are out. Congratulations, Leonard, you’re on the team.",Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 My mommy raised a gentleman.,Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Hmm. I know exactly what you should do. Unfortunately, I cannot tell you.",Sheldon,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Well, why?",Penny,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" I’m attempting to turn over a new leaf. Earlier today, it was pointed out to me that I tend to force my ideas on people.",Sheldon,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" I would have included the others, but you know exactly what would’ve happened. They would’ve taken over the project and bossed us around.",Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" I get it. Uh, just this morning, Sheldon wouldn’t let me put almond milk on my Grape-Nuts because he said it was a theoretical nut conflict.",Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 You should have told him to mind his own business.,Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Yeah. That’s better than what I did say, which was, fine, I’ll eat them with club soda.",Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 What makes them think they’re always in charge of everything?,Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Mmm, they’re alpha males.",Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Huh, what does that make us?",Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 We could be betas. They’re second in charge.,Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Okay, that sounds good.",Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 Or we could be omegas. They get pushed around by the alphas and the betas.,Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Okay, that sounds like us.",Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Whatever. There’s no alphas here, and this is your project. You’re in charge. How do you want to start?",Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 I don’t know. How do you want to start?,Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Howard, you’re grown men. You guys don’t have to do everything together.",Bernadette,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 I know. That’s why I’m spending tonight with you.,Howard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration

" (Knock, knock, knock) Sheldon. (Knock, knock, knock) Sheldon. (Knock, knock, knock) Sheldon.",Penny,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" I bet that started off as a joke, but by the third one you realized there was something strangely enjoyable about it.",Sheldon,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Yeah, I kind of want to do it again.",Penny,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" I don’t recommend it. You’ll be doing it the rest of your life. Anyway, if you’re looking for Leonard, he’s with Koothrappali.",Sheldon,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Uh, no, I actually came to talk to you.",Penny,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" How nice. Here are some topics that interest me, quantum mechanics, trains, flags.",Sheldon,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" No, no. It’s about my acting career.",Penny,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Oh, sorry. That’s not on the list.",Sheldon,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 Well.,Penny,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Oh, wait. No. How about we split the difference and discuss why Austria was an archduchy and not just a regular duchy.",Sheldon,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Okay, look, here’s the thing. I like pharmaceutical sales, it’s going great, but I have an audition for a movie, and if I get it, it could screw everything up.",Penny,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" So, often on the front of the locomotive is a large iron wedge for clearing objects off the tracks. Now, while commonly known as a cowcatcher, I prefer the more accurate cow exploder.",Sheldon,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Okay. Sheldon, let me ask you a question.",Penny,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 Mmm.,Sheldon,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 You’re really not gonna tell me?,Penny,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" No, that train has left the station. Now, we can play this one of two ways. You can say, trains, tell me more, or you can just look at me like that and I’ll start.",Sheldon,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration

 I am making molecular cocktails. This sphere is actually a cosmopolitan.,Howard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 Oh. How do you drink it?,Bernadette,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Oh, just put it in your mouth and pop it like a zit.",Howard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 I think I’ll have a beer.,Bernadette,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 First take a picture with me.,Howard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 Why?,Bernadette,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Well, Raj and I always talked about learning how to make cocktails like this together, so I taught myself and I’m putting this on Instagram so he can see it and feel like a turd. Say cheese.",Howard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 Is this about the space probe he’s working on without you?,Bernadette,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 You betcha. The very one.,Howard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Okay, so we know that previous attempts to send a message into space, like the Golden Record on Voyager, were heavily criticized.",Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Well, aliens could only play the Golden Record if they figured out how to build a record player.",Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Eh. Although, to be fair, I watched E.T. build a telephone out of a Speak & Spell and an umbrella. Dude was like a little brown MacGyver.",Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 With my honeybunch.,Howard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 You’re being childish.,Bernadette,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 No. He is. So I have a dominant personality. We all know that.,Howard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 I’m sorry. What do we know?,Bernadette,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" In social groupings, I just naturally wind up in charge.",Howard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Don’t take this the wrong way, but how many of these little booze balls have you had?",Bernadette,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 You don’t think I’m a leader?,Howard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 I was kidding. Of course you are.,Bernadette,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 Right. I couldn’t change if I wanted to.,Howard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" You better not change, because I love who you are. Now, will you need help cleaning all this up when you’re done or can you do it all by yourself?",Bernadette,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 All by myself.,Howard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 There’s my big boss man.,Bernadette,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration

 Bees talk to each other by dancing. Whales have their songs.,Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 Yeah. Penny has about twenty different ways of rolling her eyes that each mean something different.,Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Okay, so, what it sounds like is, what we want is a device that can deliver a message through not only sight, but other senses, as well.",Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" If I was at a train station and one train could take me to my current job and the other train could take me to an audition for a movie, which train should I get on?",Penny,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 Are you using trains to trick me into giving you advice?,Sheldon,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 No.,Penny,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" All right, then. You should take a third train where you audition for the movie but hold off on making a career decision until you have more information.",Sheldon,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 Oh. You’re right. I’m worried about something that hasn’t even happened yet. Huh. You are a wise man.,Penny,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Well, Penny, who’s smarter, the wise man or the person who comes to him for advice?",Sheldon,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Oh, I guess you’re right. Maybe it is the person who asks.",Penny,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" No, it’s the wise man. That’s why he’s called the wise man. You know how I know that? I’m the wise man.",Sheldon,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 I’m sorry. What was I thinking?,Penny,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Uh, just out of curiosity, why didn’t you ask Leonard for advice about this?",Sheldon,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" ‘Cause I already know what he’ll say. Wah, wah, wah, you shouldn’t do it.",Penny,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration

 Hey.,Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 Hello.,Howard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 That would be more helpful if E.T. were real.,Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Well, my feelings were real when he was about to die.",Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" My God, when he’s on the table and they use the paddles on him.",Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 And he’s all white.,Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 They zip him up in that bag.,Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 And Gertie can’t stop crying.,Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 The flower dies.,Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Okay, let’s talk about something else.",Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" All right, so it sounds like we need a way to communicate that’s simple.",Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 And doesn’t require outside machinery to be built to access it.,Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" It’s also a problem because we don’t even know if the aliens who find this can see. I mean, they might communicate in a totally different way than us.",Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Like when my dog is mad at me, she tells me by peeing in my slippers.",Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 That’s actually a valid example. Animals do deliver messages through scent.,Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 Tonight works better for me.,Sheldon,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 Okay.,Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration

" Ooh. Ooh, ooh. We could make a video-playing device that simultaneously translates the information into a tactile medium.",Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 All we have to do is rig up a 3-D communication system.,Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" We, we can totally do that.",Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 I know.,Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 This is great.,Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Yeah, you know what else it is?",Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 What?,Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 Exactly what Sheldon and Howard said.,Howard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration

 I’m sorry. I was trying to think of what rhymes with nose of the aardvark.,Sheldon,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 We want you back on the project with us.,Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Well, well, well, did you hear that, Howard?",Sheldon,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Look, we admit it. The idea that you guys came up with was really good, and I’d love your help.",Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 I suppose it couldn’t have been easy for you to say that.,Howard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" It wasn’t, so are you in?",Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 Certainly.,Sheldon,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 Sure.,Howard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Great. Now that we’re all on the same page, let’s get together tonight and work on it.",Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Get together tonight? Leonard, stop trying to control everything, and give poor Raj a chance to come up with what we should do. Go ahead, Raj.",Sheldon,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration

 Yeah. I started that rumour.,Penny,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 The apartment. ,Scene,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Okay, since we agree on the delivery system for the message, maybe we should talk about what the message could be.",Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Okay, it’s just an audition. Why am I nervous? Maybe it’s a good thing. Just means I want it. And I can have it. This feels right. Why did I ever give this up? (Out loud) I’m starting to remember.",(voiceover),8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 The apartment. ,Scene,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration

" Uh, building on that, we should order dinner.",Sheldon,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 How is that building on what he just said?,Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Building on what Sheldon said, I could go for Chinese.",Howard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Hang on. Building on what Leonard said, no one built on what I said.",Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration

 I saw the menu. They have soy cheese.,Howard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration

 It’s not Simon Says.,Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration

 You let a guy sit on me.,Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 He was dressed as Princess Leia. It made a nice picture.,Howard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration

 You quit acting?,Girl,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration

 I heard you can make good money doing that.,Girl,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Yeah, it’s going okay, but I do miss this sometimes.",Penny,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration

" Well, I think we should show what earthlings look like.",Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 The plaque they sent up on the Pioneer probe had a drawing of a naked man and woman on it.,Howard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Yeah, I never cared for that. It’s advertising to predator races just how soft and squishy we are.",Sheldon,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 Squeeze yourself.,Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Oh, don’t be offended. You know, of the four of us, you have the most veal-like consistency.",Sheldon,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Well, maybe there’s a way to appear non-aggressive, but also be able to protect ourselves if necessary. Like smiling and waving with one hand, but the other hand holding the severed head of a tiger.",Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 You want to send a passive-aggressive message out into the universe? That’s ridiculous.,Howard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Oh, you mean passive-aggressive like posting pictures of you and your wife eating cosmopolitan balls that you know belong in my mouth?",Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Perhaps Howard meant passive-aggressive like asking our group to help on your project, and then only choosing Leonard.",Sheldon,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Look, I’m sorry I hurt your feelings, but you do have strong personalities and always end up taking over.",Raj,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 It’s not always.,Howard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" What about when we went to Comic-Con and dressed like Jabba the Hutt? You got to be Jabba’s head, and I got to be his fat slug butt.",Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration

 That soft pink alien looks delicious.,Alien,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration

 You know what? You’re right. I should have asked you.,Howard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Yeah, and if he does ask you, go. It’s amazing.",Sheldon,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Okay, and if we’re talking about being left out of things, you guys went to Skywalker Ranch without us.",Howard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
" Oh, I recommend that, too. That was a magical experience.",Sheldon,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration
 Wait a minute. Sheldon spent a whole day with James Earl Jones and never told any of us.,Leonard,8.0,21.0,The Communication Deterioration

 We just spent two hours in traffic. Did you think to mention to me that you liked our paper?,Leonard,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Of course I did, but it’s a mother’s job to make sure her child’s self-esteem is not dependent on anyone’s approval.",Hofstadter,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" That’s so sweet, you think I have self-esteem.",Leonard,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Interesting. You can believe that, but God filling an ark with animals two-by-two is nonsense.",Cooper,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" What did they feed the lions, Mother?",Sheldon,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" The floating bodies of drowned sinners, of course.",Cooper,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Listen, Leonard’s mom is a renowned psychiatrist and woman of science. Can you please keep the Bible babble to yourself while she’s here?",Sheldon,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 Are you ashamed of me?,Cooper,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Of course not. I love you. I’m just embarrassed by the things you believe, do and say.",Sheldon,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 The apartment.,Scene,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 What does that mean?,Leonard,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 You’ve been on and off with this woman for seven years and engaged for one year. One has to wonder if there’s a problem. Are you having satisfactory intercourse?,Hofstadter,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 You must be very proud of your son.,Cooper,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Oh, yes. He recently argued a case before the Supreme Court.",Hofstadter,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 He did?,Cooper,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Seems odd to try and impress your mother with your sexual prowess. But then, you always did have that unresolved Oedipal complex.",Hofstadter,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" See, this right here, what you’re doing, can you please not do that around Sheldon’s mom?",Leonard,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Why? Are you attracted to her, too?",Hofstadter,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Of course not. She’s, she’s just a very sweet and God-fearing lady, and you have to be respectful of her beliefs.",Leonard,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Leonard, I’m an adult. I know how to conduct myself around people from different walks of life.",Hofstadter,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 Thank you.,Leonard,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" If you could run out and get a PhD, that might make her like you.",Leonard,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 Really? It didn’t work for you.,Penny,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 Do you think the moms will get along?,Amy,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Uh, I don’t know. They’re pretty different.",Leonard,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Maybe they’ll be best friends. One of them is brilliant, one is sweet and simple. Sound familiar?",Sheldon,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Likewise. I read your paper, it was very impressive.",Hofstadter,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Oh, thank you.",Sheldon,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Oh, he was a handful.",Cooper,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 I was a handful.,Sheldon,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" You still are. Uh, Mom, hey, tell Mary the story about how I made a Van der Graaf generator out of our vacuum cleaner.",Leonard,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Doctor Hofstadter, I want you to meet my mother, Mary.",Sheldon,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 : So nice to meet you.,Hofstadter,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Nice to meet you, too. How was your flight?",Cooper,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 Very pleasant. And yours?,Hofstadter,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Lovely. Almost as if someone, not saying who, was watching over the plane.",Cooper,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" You’re kidding, right?",Hofstadter,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion

 You don’t look very happy.,Hofstadter,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Well, I had just begun puberty. It was figuratively and literally one of the hairiest moments of my life.",Sheldon,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Oh, you mean this son. Uh, sure, he’s terrific.",Hofstadter,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Beverly, would you like to see the math I worked out to support our hypothesis?",Sheldon,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" You mean, my hypothesis. I hypothesized it all by myself.",Leonard,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Calm down, dear. Mary, I’m curious. When did you first realize that your son had such a remarkable mind?",Hofstadter,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Ooh, good question. Everyone loves stories about Sheldon Cooper, boy genius.",Sheldon,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Well, I would have to say when he was 13 and tried to build a nuclear reactor in the tool shed.",Cooper,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 Where is she from again?,Hofstadter,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 East Texas.,Leonard,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 Ugh.,Hofstadter,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Hey, look who’s here.",Leonard,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Oh, Doctor Hofstadter, it’s so good to see you again.",Sheldon,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 No. It turns out that this little scallywag was trying to use my Visa card to buy uranium from an African warlord in the country of Chad.,Cooper,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 Sounds like Sheldon was a handful.,Hofstadter,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 We did not. That’s not true. Can I speak to you alone for a second?,Leonard,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Oh, sure.",Sheldon,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 It came from Tiffany’s.,Leonard,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion

 Uch? The bible is uch to you?,Cooper,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" No, I’m sorry. That was inappropriate. As a psychiatrist, I know how important people’s superstitions can be to them.",Hofstadter,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" You want to talk about superstitions? Sheldon sent me the books you wrote, all that nonsense about superegos and ids. What bull dropped that on the barn floor?",Cooper,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 Shelly does not like change.,Cooper,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Oh, true. But all the clenching in the world will not keep testicles in your abdomen.",Sheldon,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Hey, sorry, got caught up at work. Hi, Beverly.",Penny,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion

 You remember my mother.,Sheldon,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Ooh, this is a good one.",Sheldon,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Now, the first thing you have to know about Shelly is ever since he was a little boy, he was always concerned with the well-being of others. And he didn’t think that it was fair for people to pay for electricity, so he was gonna power the entire town for free.",Cooper,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 Tell her about the uranium. Tell her about the uranium.,Sheldon,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Oh, well. Oh, this is adorable. When he arranged to get some yellowcake from Chad, I thought he was talking about Twinkies from one of his friends.",Cooper,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 But I wasn’t. ‘Cause I didn’t have any friends.,Sheldon,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Oh, lovely. Must have been very expensive.",Hofstadter,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Oh, no, not at all. No, we, uh, found a place online that, uh, repurposes diamond drill bits.",Sheldon,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion

" You mean the box, right?",Sheldon,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 Keep walking.,Leonard,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 Really doesn’t matter to me how much he spent on the ring. I think.,Penny,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 Did I misspeak about the ring?,Sheldon,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Yes, and we’ll get back to that. But, uh, even with your mother here, you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom. You’re like one of those elephant seal pups that steals the milk from two mothers.",Leonard,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 Do you mean what marine biologists refer to as super weaning?,Sheldon,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 I put on pants.,Stuart,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion

 Uch.,Hofstadter,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Well, you doled out affection as a reward for achievement, a proven way to raise a child. Or train a rat.",Sheldon,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 But look how well you turned out.,Hofstadter,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" I’d feign modesty at this point, but who would believe me? Still, you need to consider how successful Leonard’s brother and sister are.",Sheldon,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 His name is Sigmund Freud.,Hofstadter,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Hey, look at that. You both believe in Jewish bearded guys.",Penny,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 Stay out of this.,Cooper,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 Mm-hmm.,Penny,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 At least the bearded man that I believe in preaches love and compassion. All yours talks about is why you hold in your poop and want to crawl back inside your mama.,Cooper,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 It’s fascinating. How can someone as enlightened as Sheldon come from someone like you?,Hofstadter,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Oh, yes. Hi, Mary.",Penny,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Good to see you again, dear.",Cooper,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Ah, yeah, now that’s what I’m talking about.",Penny,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion

" Oh, yeah, let me show you the ring.",Penny,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Why don’t we all stop hitting ourselves and talk about something safe, you know, like shoes or how cute little Chinese babies are.",Penny,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 It is not my fault that your mother likes me better than she likes you.,Sheldon,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Well, come on now, she did kind of start it.",Penny,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Doesn’t matter, a good Christian would’ve turned the other cheek. On the other hand, a good Texan would’ve shot her, so, I just kind of split the difference. Hey, who’s in the mood for spaghetti and hot dogs?",Cooper,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Oh, me.",Leonard,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Well, it’s carrots, so gonna say very.",Stuart,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 Sorry we have to do this.,Howard,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 Bernadette’s not wrong. She does work hard around here.,Stuart,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Yeah, maybe it’s a good thing if she stops babying you so much.",Raj,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 She doesn’t baby me.,Howard,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 I saw her pull you home in a wagon.,Stuart,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Yes, you are a super weaner.",Leonard,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Well, now I have to correct you. As a bit of an elephant seal buff, the more accurate comparison would be when two mother seals actively seek to nourish the same pup. So I believe the term you’re looking for is a double mother suckler.",Sheldon,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Yeah, you’re right. That is the term I’m looking for. You are a dirty double mother suckler.",Leonard,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Okay, well, now that we have the terminology straightened out. How dare you.",Sheldon,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 We’re not in a rush. We’ll set a date when the time is right.,Penny,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 The apartment.,Scene,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 Wow. When does that start?,Leonard,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 So needy. Come to Mommy.,Hofstadter,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" It’s okay, go ahead.",Penny,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Oh, my son.",Hofstadter,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion

 A coffee shop.,Scene,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" You’re right. It’s time for me to act like an adult in this marriage. Starting with my husbandly duty of taking out the trash. Bernie, I made a mess.",Howard,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Face it, dude, Bernadette treats you the same way your mother used to, and that was not a healthy relationship.",Raj,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" For your information, I twisted my ankle chasing the ice cream truck.",Howard,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 Look at that. You cleaned it up all by yourself.,Bernadette,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 I’m so glad that you and I were able to bury the hatchet.,Cooper,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Me, too. And I respect your right to your beliefs.",Hofstadter,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 And I will pray for you.,Cooper,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Therefore, I would like to initiate a new protocol wherein I shower you with unconditional love.",Hofstadter,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 I taught her that.,Sheldon,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Leonard, I always made you earn my affection, but today I realize that there’s more than one way to raise a child.",Hofstadter,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
" Yes, I cleaned it up all by myself. Honestly, I don’t know why you complain so… okay, maybe I missed one spot. Just leave.",Howard,8.0,23.0,The Maternal Combustion
 Okay.,Sheldon,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" Nope, never.",Penny,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 Did you ever do anything like this since we’ve been?,Leonard,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 All right.,Penny,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" And then nothing. I stopped it. But it still bothers me, and I wanted you to know.",Leonard,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 And then what?,Penny,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 Nothing really. It was just kissing.,Leonard,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 What did you do?,Penny,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" Okay, um, well, there was this girl.",Leonard,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" No, you told me.",Penny,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" Okay, well, there, there was a lot of drinking and craziness going on.",Leonard,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 Yeah.,Penny,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" Remember, uh, a couple years back when I was on that research ship in the North Sea?",Leonard,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 What?,Penny,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 Yes.,Penny,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 Because we love each other.,Leonard,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 Yes.,Penny,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 Just kissing.,Penny,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 Right.,Leonard,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" Look, I’m not happy this happened, but I think I can get past it. I mean, we weren’t engaged at the time, and it was just kissing.",Penny,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 Yeah?,Leonard,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 Okay.,Penny,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" I can do that. Uh, uh, from now on, this mouth, you and food, that’s it.",Leonard,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" Uh, keep your mouth off other women.",Penny,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" See, now I’m confused. I mean, what, what am I supposed to do?",Leonard,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" No, I don’t want there to be secrets between us.",Penny,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 Would you rather I didn’t tell you?,Leonard,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" Really? Because to me, it seems like we’re about to get married and you’re trying to sabotage it.",Penny,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" Well, like I said, we’re about to get married, and I, I want a clean slate. No secrets.",Leonard,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" Bye, Sheldon.",Amy,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" If I stick a light bulb on this, wouldn’t it make a great lamp for my bedroom?",Emily,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination

 Ooh. Hot date?,Raj,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 That’s what you’re thinking about?,Amy,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 I know. Do you think I should start watching The Flash TV show?,Sheldon,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 Can you believe it’s been five years since our first date?,Amy,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" Oh, your buddy got mugged by some baby farm animals.",Penny,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 What happened?,Sheldon,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 Can it wait until I put a Band-Aid on a goat bite?,Leonard,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 The apartment.,Scene,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" Yeah. Exactly. You know, I waited ten years to see a guy everyone knows can fly, fly.",Sheldon,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 I get it. Smallville almost wrecked you.,Leonard,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" Oh, no, not just a season. If I’m in, I’m in for the whole run, even if the quality declines.",Sheldon,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination

 Whenever you’re ready.,Sheldon,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" Oh, sure, I’d love to.",Amy,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" Irony’s not really my strong suit. But I have been getting better with sarcasm, if you want to give that a try.",Sheldon,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" Really? That’s the commitment issue you’re wrestling with? Sheldon, do you understand the irony of your fixation on a man with super speed, while after five years all I can get out of you is a distracted make-out session on a couch?",Amy,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 Excuse me. Starting to watch a television show that might run for years isn’t a decision to take lightly. I’m wrestling with a big commitment issue here.,Sheldon,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" I didn’t kill anything. You did, talking about your stupid TV show.",Amy,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" You’re right, you did kind of kill the mood.",Sheldon,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 What are you doing?,Amy,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" Yes. I thought, I can’t decide if I should watch The Flash TV show. I know, I’ll ask Amy. Anyway.",Sheldon,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 Are any of them me?,Amy,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" Well, one of the things.",Sheldon,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" Well, then I guess bring a blanket. The grass gets damp at night.",Bernadette,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" Well, what if it’s one consenting adult and one adult who pretends to consent because he’s afraid of being alone?",Raj,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" The only issue is that everybody has their own thing, and as long as it’s two consenting adults, I guess I don’t see the harm in it.",Bernadette,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" Oh, good. You’re here. I need your assistance.",Sheldon,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 Hey.,Leonard,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" Well, now we know, next time we go to the farmers’ market, the order is petting zoo first, then buy vegetables.",Penny,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination

" No, no, no. Hey, you should totally get it. In fact, I’ll buy it for you.",Raj,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 All right. Never mind.,Emily,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" I guess I’m just more of a Pottery Barn, Crate and Barrel kind of guy. Maybe Pier 1 if I really want to cut loose.",Raj,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 Oh. Is this freaking you out?,Emily,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" You’re kidding, right?",Raj,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 Yeah. I wish I’d fought harder for the rest of ’em.,Leonard,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 That carrot was delicious.,Penny,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 Mmm. My pleasure.,Leonard,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 I’m gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment of watching an entire season of a new show.,Leonard,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 Yeah. I’m tapping out. Leonard?,Penny,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 It was. I asked her if she thought I should watch The Flash.,Sheldon,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" Well, Sheldon, when you’re kissing a girl, she expects the attention to be on her.",Penny,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" Baffling, right? We were necking like a couple of hooligans under the school bleachers. I stopped so I could ask the question. Next thing I know, good-bye, kissy face. Hello, yelly face.",Sheldon,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 And that made her angry?,Penny,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" Well, I just asked her if I should start watching the new Flash TV series.",Sheldon,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 That’s probably it. What’d you say to her?,Penny,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 Yes.,Sheldon,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 Okay. Were you talking before she got upset?,Penny,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
" Amy’s mad at me, and I’m not clear why.",Sheldon,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
 Mmm. So what do you need help with?,Penny,8.0,24.0,The Commitment Determination
