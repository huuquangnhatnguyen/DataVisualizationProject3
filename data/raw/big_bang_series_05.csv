" As a child, I loved Wesley Crusher, Wil Wheaton’s character on Star Trek. So, I drove for hours by bus to a Star Trek convention at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear, so that I could get my Wesley Crusher action figure signed. But he never showed, because apparently, it was cooler for him to be the lower-left corner on Hollywood Squares. Oh, damn! The floppy failed. Well, whoever was in charge of quality control at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989, congratulations, you just made the list.",Sheldon,5.0,5.0,The Russian Rocket Reaction
" Oh! Oh, God!",All,5.0,5.0,The Russian Rocket Reaction
 How did Wil Wheaton get on the list?,Amy,5.0,5.0,The Russian Rocket Reaction

" Wait, let me see if I got this right. You actually asked Bernadette to leave your house in the middle of the night?",Leonard,5.0,5.0,The Russian Rocket Reaction
" No, Leonard, this is your last chance. One day, a historian is going to come to you and say, is it true you were friends with Dr. Sheldon Cooper?

" Well, that, that’s good. I’m glad you came to that. But before you do, let me just ask you a big picture question.",Penny,5.0,5.0,The Russian Rocket Reaction
" Oh, God, you’re right. I took our love and threw it under his bus-sized mother. I need to apologize.",Bernadette,5.0,5.0,The Russian Rocket Reaction
 It’s not for us to judge. We’re just here to provide comfort and support while you come to grips with what a despicable thing you’ve done.,Amy,5.0,5.0,The Russian Rocket Reaction

 Got it. Can I have my water?,Leonard,5.0,5.0,The Russian Rocket Reaction
" At this moment, our relationship exists in two mutually contradictory states. Until you either do not go or go to Wil Wheaton’s party, you are simultaneously my friend and not my friend. I’m characterizing this phenomenon as Schrodinger’s Friendship.",Sheldon,5.0,5.0,The Russian Rocket Reaction

 Fair enough. It’d give you the right to rule a replica of England.,Sheldon,5.0,5.0,The Russian Rocket Reaction

Back home, there’s a girl works at the Wal-Mart. Tall, tall girl. Woman could hunt geese with a rake.

Long story short, today that woman travels the world with a semi-professional basketball player and two beautiful mixed-race babies.",Cooper,5.0,6.0,The Rhinitis Revelation

" Uh, yeah, it’s Raj’s sister. It’s kind of tough. She’s in India. Also, her parents aren’t happy she’s dating someone white.",Leonard,5.0,6.0,The Rhinitis Revelation
" Oh, that’s a funny turn, isn’t it? You never think about it going the other way. Well, you can’t force things. You need to figure out if you’re in a relationship or if you’re just calling it one. It’s like they say, a cat can have kittens in the oven but that don’t make ’em biscuits.",Cooper,5.0,6.0,The Rhinitis Revelation

 You threw up?,Bernadette,5.0,18.0,The Werewolf Transformation

" Hey, listen, I kind of made plans with the guys this weekend, but then I wondered, because we’re in this relationship-beta-test, if I should have asked you first. Then I thought if I did check with you first, you’d think that I was taking things to seriously. And then, then I got a nosebleed.",Leonard,5.0,19.0,The Weekend Vortex
 You don’t have to check with me. Do whatever you want.,Penny,5.0,19.0,The Weekend Vortex

" Really, what were you hoping for?",Penny,5.0,19.0,The Weekend Vortex
" I don’t know, maybe that you’d be a little upset, and then you’d realize that I’m a stallion that has to run free. And that would turn you on a little.",Leonard,5.0,19.0,The Weekend Vortex

" Look, if you don’t want to go to the party, just don’t go. You’re a grown man. Act like one. Tell Amy you want to spend the weekend having a sleepover and playing video games with your friends. Maybe she’ll dig it. Women like a firm hand on the tiller.",Howard,5.0,19.0,The Weekend Vortex

" Sheldon, my relatives are going to want to talk to you, and you’re going to be sitting there playing a game? Isn’t that a little rude?",Amy,5.0,19.0,The Weekend Vortex
" Oh, I got that covered. Headset. I won’t hear a word the old geezers are saying.",Sheldon,5.0,19.0,The Weekend Vortex

And I said, well, no, I promised the guys I was going to play a video game with them all weekend. And she said, that sounds like fun, can I come, too? And then I didn’t answer for a second, and then she said, well, do you not want me to come? And then I bought her a new laptop and the game, and she’s parking the car right now.",Howard,5.0,19.0,The Weekend Vortex

" Mmm, you liked Professor Guyster’s wedding.",Leonard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Yeah, I hate wedding receptions. I wish the bride and groom would take a cue from Bilbo Baggins, slip on the ring, disappear and everyone goes home.",Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Well, can you make it soon. There’s a battle royale going on over the seating charts. In one corner, Bernadette’s mom, and the other three, mine.",Howard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 And it’s been wonderful.,Koothrappali,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Oh, that’s great. Let’s open it up and put him in there.",Penny,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Look, it was actually designed for my vintage Mr Spock action figure.",Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Awesome!,Leonard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Mmm. And, I got you a transporter too!",Penny,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Wow. No, it’s great. Also, uh, mint in box.",Leonard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" You’re welcome. Don’t worry, I didn’t forget about you. Leonard, I got you a label maker.",Penny,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Not this time. Then they wouldn’t be special. Thanks Penny.,Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Ooh, am I about to get a rare Sheldon Cooper hug?",Penny,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Well this calls for an expression of gratitude.,Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" We love you, and we accept your alternate lifestyle. Just keep it to yourself.",Koothrappali,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" It’s finally happening. You’re coming out of the closet, aren’t you?",Koothrappali,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Listen, uh, there’s something I want to talk to you about. I, I wasn’t ready until now, but I think it’s time.",Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Oh I’m sure you can. Just give it a minute.,Koothrappali,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Pretty good, can’t complain.",Koothrappali,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Hello Mummy, Daddy, how are you?",skype),5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 MUON!,Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Yesterday you made fun of me for eating lox.,Howard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Listen, I love your charming racist humour, but any chance you could not knock my religion while she’s here.",Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Hindus do the same thing. Except they leave room for a cow.,Howard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 The nuns always chaparoned the dances at my high school. They used to make us leave room between us for the holy spirit.,Bernadette,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Oh yes. In my culture it’s expected to have a chaparone to oversee a first date. Plus I want to make a good impression and, no offence, but with you guys here I look like six two.",Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Are you sure you want us here when you meet this woman?,Bernadette,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 A restaurant.,Scene,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Yeah, yeah, my mom gave me the same lecture about my virginity. Gotta tell you, it was a lot more fun taking it out and playing with it.",Penny,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Once you open the box it loses its value.,Leonard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Sure, what’s up?",Leonard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Hi, you guys got a minute?",Penny,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 It’s like looking at the universe naked. (Shivers) ,Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Yeah, I’m glad.",Leonard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Quantum physics makes me so happy.,Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction

 Dr Cooper. Dr Cooper?,Spock,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 The apartment.,Scene,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Please have a seat. (To Bernadette) I’m thinking double wedding!,Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 You too.,Lakshmi,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Nice to meet you.,Howard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 And this is Howard.,Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Hello.,Bernadette,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Oh, uh, these are my, my friends. This is Bernadette.",Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Yeah, it was fun, I walked in and two different guys got asthma attacks. Felt pretty good.",Penny,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 You went to the comic-book store by yourself?,Leonard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Uh, from Stuart at the comic-book store.",Penny,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Where did you get that?,Leonard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Ah! A vintage, mint in box, 1975 Mego Star Trek transporter with real transporter action. Hot-darn!",Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Anyway, I got a little residual cheque from my commercial and I thought, hey, how about I get the guys a little thankyou to pay them back. So, Sheldon, ta-da!",Penny,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 It’s different. You’re people don’t worship lox.,Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Oh, of course. Set phasers to dumb, right? (Wakes up in bed) Goody, goody, goody. This is wrong. This is wrong. I’m so excited, but this is wrong. I’m gonna do it. I’m doing it. I did it. Oh, that’s what I always thought 1975 smelled like. One to beam down Mr Scott. Aye, aye, Mr Spock. Energise. (Spins toy). Energise. (Tries to spin toy. It sticks. Tries to get Spock out and toy falls apart.) Don’t be broken. Please don’t be broken. (To Spock toy) What did you make me do? Okay, okay, think. (Sees Leonard’s toy) It’s only logical.",Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Sheldon, wait. You have to wake up first.",Spock,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Illogical. Oh, damn it Spock, you’re right. I’ll do it.",Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Therefore? To not play with it would be?,Spock,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 To be played with.,Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Consider this. What is the purpose of a toy?,Spock,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Well, I’m not going to dignify that with a response.",Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Yes, and to open it would destroy it’s value. But remember, like me, you also have a human half.",Spock,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 But it’s mint in box.,Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 No!,Together,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 C’mon can’t we just open one up and take a…,Penny,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 They’re Collectables.,Leonard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 They’re mint in box.,Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Why, they’re just toys?",Penny,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Oh dear Lord. No!,Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Down here, on your desk.",Spock,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" I know a fake marriage isn’t an honest way to live, but you of all people must know how difficult it is to come out in our culture.",Lakshmi,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Like, dude on dude, but with women?",Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 I’m gay.,Lakshmi,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Say again.,Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" I’m on the one where I’m on a lot of pressure from my parents to get married and settle down, and have a family, and I’m going to do it so they don’t find out I’m gay.",Lakshmi,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Okay, what page are you on?",Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Me too. But before we get their hopes up we should probably make sure we’re on the same page.,Lakshmi,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 I’d like to tell them things are going well.,Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Four missed calls, two text messages, and a failed video chat. I win. So, what are we going to tell them.",Lakshmi,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Nice to meet you too.,Lakshmi,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Oh, yes. You must be Lakshmi. Uh, nice to meet you.",Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Excuse me, are you Rajesh?",Girl,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Oh, no, no, I get a say in it. But I’m sure whoever shows up will be better company than a threesome I’ve been having with Aunt Jemima and Mrs Butterworth.",Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" So, arranged marriages. The parents just decide, and then you have to get married?",Bernadette,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Well clearly you’ve never been to brunch with my cousins.,Howard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Raj’s apartment.,Scene,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 I am very disappointed in you. You broke your toy and switched it with Leonard’s. You should be ashamed of yourself.,Spock,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" What is it now, tiny Spock?",Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Hello again, Sheldon.",Spock,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Oh dear. Two suns and no sunscreen.,Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Sheldon’s bedroom. Sheldon writhes in bed, then wakes up on an alien planet. ",Scene,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Thankyou. And once again, my baloney likes girls. Wait-wait. You don’t want to put a bit of that in your mouth without trying my homemade chantilly cream. Yeah, okay, that time I heard it.",Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 That’s disappointing. You were exactly the kind of phoney-baloney husband I was looking for.,Lakshmi,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 W-w-with women. I like to boogie with women.,Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Got you.,Lakshmi,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" I’m not going to dignify that with a response. Now, to the matter at hand. You need to play with the transporter toy.",Spock,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Was I hit on the head by a coconut.,Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" It is not the only logical explanation. For example, you could be hallucinating after being hit on the head by, say, a coconut.",Spock,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Fascinating. The only logical explanation is that this is a dream.,Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 I need to speak with you.,Spock,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Spock?,Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Why me, of all people?",Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Yeah. Sure. How are things going?,Howard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Hey, uh, can I run something by you? It’s about Lakshmi.",Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Yep, one sec. (Puts thing in mouth.) Ah, good. Ma would have killed me if she’d found out I’d broke my retainer.",Howard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Ready for lunch?,Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Howard’s laboratory. Howard is soldering something.,Scene,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Very well. Cooper to Enterprise, one to beam up. Energise. (Throws Spock away. Get’s attacked by a Gorn. Wakes up.) Ah. Tiny Spock. Help.",Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Fine. I will just use the transporter. Oh, right. You broke it.",Spock,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" You know what you are? Well, you’re a green blooded buzzkill. Perhaps it’s time you beam on out of here.",Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 I come from a factory in Taiwan. Now do the right thing.,Spock,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Well, let’s see. Yup, three missed calls.",Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 I bet our parents are dying to know how things are going here.,Lakshmi,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Well, you start off by trying to make chocolate souffle, and when it falls you panic, quickly change the name, and voila! Lava cake.",Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Impressive. What goes into making something like that.,Lakshmi,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Well, I hope you saved room for chocolate lava cake.",Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" My goodness, that was delicious.",Lakshmi,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 You’re the one who told me to play with it.,Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 The apartment. Sheldon is working on his laptop. Spock is looking at him judgementally. He switches the two toys.,Scene,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Do you hear how homophobic you sound?,Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Yes, to other gay people.",Howard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 I can’t believe your attitude. I thought you were in favour of gay people getting married.,Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 So you’re seriously thinking about marrying someone you’re never going to have sex with.,Howard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Because this one wants to marry me. I might never find another one who does.,Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Why don’t you tell your parents you want to try and find someone else, you know, maybe one who hasn’t slept with more women than you.",Howard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" It’s a great deal. We both get our parents off our backs. I don’t have to come home to an empty apartment every night, plus, once I’m married, I can finally eat carbs again and let myself go.",Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Well, yes. But my compromises are about which bedspread to buy, or whose turn it is to do the laundry, Bernadette’s or my mom’s.",Howard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 I like to boogie.,Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Fill in the blank. I love the nightlife?,Lakshmi,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" That’s Unbreakable by Khloe and Lamar. And for your information, it’s unisex.",Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Really? The chocolate lava cake? The little soaps in the bathroom? And I’m sorry, but you’re wearing more perfume than I am.",Lakshmi,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 I’m not gay.,Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Well, there is a rumour back in New Delhi that you’re, how shall we say, comfortable in a sari.",Lakshmi,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" We hit a couple of bumps. She lives over on Manhattan Beach, so it takes over an hour to get there. And she’s a lesbian.",Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 It’s broken.,Leonard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Mmmmm!,Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Yes.,Penny,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" You know, you’re right. I mean, it’s from you, I’m never going to sell it. I’m opening it.",Leonard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Leonard, I bought you this because I wanted you to have fun with it. I don’t want it to just sit in this box.",Penny,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" My problem is that I don’t want you to break Leonard’s toy, which you probably did by shaking it. She shook it. We all saw her.",Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 What is your problem?,Penny,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Perhaps you should look with your eyes, and not your muscular Nebraska man-hands.",Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 I dunno. I just think it’s a waste. (Picks up box. Sheldon screams.) Relax. I’m just looking at the box.,Penny,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 I thought where you come from they don’t have emotions.,Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Well I am unhappy.,Spock,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Why? I got away with it. Leonard has his toy, and he’s never going to open it, so he won’t know it’s broken. And I have a toy that isn’t broken. Everybody’s happy.",Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Trust me, it gets old after a while. You must right your wrong, Sheldon.",Spock,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" No. If I got on the bridge of the Enterprise, I would never, ever leave.",Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" If I told you to jump off the bridge of the Enterprise, would you do it?",Spock,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Oh, I don’t want a broken toy. (Switches them back again. Penny and Leonard enter.) Nothing!",Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Leonard, Penny, I just, I want you both to know that I regret my actions toward the two of you. That’s a lie.",Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Mmm.,Penny,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Okay, that I believe.",Leonard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 My Mr Spock doll came to me in a dream and forced me to open it. And when the toy broke I switched it for yours. Later he encouraged me to do the right thing and I defied him. And then I was attacked by a Gorn.,Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 What is the truth?,Penny,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 I can’t because that was a lie. Yours was broken in an earthquake. And that’s a lie.,Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Well, you should talk to Stuart.",Leonard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 I didn’t. That was a lie. I opened my own toy. And it was already broken so I switched them.,Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Why would you open mine?,Leonard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Look, Howard, you’re in a relationship. You know you have to make compromises.",Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Okay, well, so the reason that might sound crazy, is ’cause it’s crazy.",Howard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" She was looking for a husband so she can appear to be straight. And you know, it sounded crazy to me at first, but I’m actually thinking about doing it.",Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Then why did she even go out with you?,Howard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Well, you know whenever you and I would try to hit on women in bars, and they’d blow us off, and then we’d tell each other they were probably gay. It’s like that. Except this time it’s true.",Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" What do you mean, she’s a lesbian?",Howard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 What?,Penny,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Oh, my goodness. Aren’t you the cutest little Yorkie ever? You got him for me?",Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Not necessarily. I think we’ve found someone for you to cuddle with. (Pulls a puppy out of her bag.),Bernadette,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" So, while I’m waiting for this mysterious perfect match, who may or may not exist, I’m supposed to just be alone.",Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Well, actually we kind of agreed to disagree on that one, but we both think you shouldn’t marry this woman.",Howard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 We believe there’s someone out there who’ll love you for you.,Bernadette,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 I told everybody.,Howard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" What, you told her?",Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Raj, Howie told me what’s going on with you and Lakshmi.",Bernadette,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" This is a treat, what brings you guys by?",Raj,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Well I told you, you don’t, it’s mint in box.",Leonard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 I cannot believe you guys aren’t going to play with these.,Penny,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Really? I don’t even notice any more.,Leonard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 That was weird.,Penny,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 Nothing. I said nothing.,Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
 What?,Leonard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" So, is that one mine.",Leonard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Hey, Raj, you didn’t send your RSVP in. I’m supposed to ask you if you’re bringing someone to the wedding.",Howard,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Oh, that’s very kind of you. Next time I have a hankering to wash down a D cell battery with a jar of old pickle juice, I’ll come a-knocking.",Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Okay, you’re right, I eat your food a lot. How about this, you can raid my fridge any time you want.",Penny,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction
" Oh, you know what they say, the best things in life are free.",Sheldon,5.0,20.0,The Transporter Malfunction

" That’s really nice of you, Howard.",Raj,5.0,21.0,The Hawking Excitation
" Hm, it’s no big deal.",Howard,5.0,21.0,The Hawking Excitation
" Leonard, do you recall when I said that I was going to revolutionize humanity’s understanding of the Higgs boson particle, and you said, Sheldon, it’s two a.m., get out of my bedroom?",Sheldon,5.0,21.0,The Hawking Excitation
" Boy, a restraining order from Stephen Hawking. It’ll look so nice next to the ones he’s already got from Leonard Nimoy, Carl Sagan and Stan Lee.",Leonard,5.0,21.0,The Hawking Excitation
 Get out.,Howard,5.0,21.0,The Hawking Excitation
" Oh, now they’re so much smarter than dogs. Have you seen them on those little bicycles?",Sheldon,5.0,21.0,The Hawking Excitation
 Get out of my lab.,Howard,5.0,21.0,The Hawking Excitation

 You can make him do anything you want.,Raj,5.0,21.0,The Hawking Excitation
 I do.,Howard,5.0,21.0,The Hawking Excitation
 You do realize you own his ass right now.,Leonard,5.0,21.0,The Hawking Excitation
 Walking away.,Sheldon,5.0,21.0,The Hawking Excitation
 Hang on. Are you saying the rest of us are dogs?,Howard,5.0,21.0,The Hawking Excitation
 Try to put yourself in my place. Imagine you’re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but dogs. And then it turns out there’s another human being.,Sheldon,5.0,21.0,The Hawking Excitation

 You walk away.,Howard,5.0,21.0,The Hawking Excitation
 How do I do that?,Sheldon,5.0,21.0,The Hawking Excitation

 What if he doesn’t?,Leonard,5.0,21.0,The Hawking Excitation

Oh, seriously though, Howard, you’re actually one of the most intelligent people I know. And that’s a zinger, because you’re not. I’ve always thought that you’d make someone a fine husband someday.
