            Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper are both brilliant physicists
            working at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California. They are colleagues,
            best friends, and roommates, although in all capacities their
            relationship is always tested primarily by Sheldon's regimented,
            deeply eccentric, and non-conventional ways. They are also friends
            with their Cal Tech colleagues mechanical engineer Howard Wolowitz
            and astrophysicist Rajesh Koothrappali. The foursome spend their
            time working on their individual work projects, playing video games,
            watching science-fiction movies, or reading comic books. As they are
            self-professed nerds, all have little or no luck with women. When
            Penny, a pretty woman and an aspiring actress from Omaha, moves into
            the apartment across the hall from Leonard and Sheldon's, Leonard
            has another aspiration in life, namely to get Penny to be his
            girlfriend.
