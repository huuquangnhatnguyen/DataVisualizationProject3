        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper are both brilliant physicists
            working at Cal Tech. They are colleagues, best friends, and
            roommates, although their relationship is always tested primarily by
            Sheldon's regimented, deeply eccentric, and non-conventional ways.
            When Penny, a pretty woman and an aspiring actress from Omaha, moves
            into the apartment across the hall from Leonard and Sheldon's,
            Leonard has another aspiration in life - get Penny to be his
            girlfriend.

          <h3>Leonard Hofstadter</h3>
          <p>
            Played by actor Johnny Galecki, Leonard is an experimental physicist
            with an IQ of 173 who works at Caltech. Originally from New Jersey,
            he is more socially adept than his friends and often serves as the
            group's mediator. Leonard shares an apartment with Sheldon for much
            of the series. He has a complicated relationship with his
            accomplished family and eventually marries Penny, with whom he
            starts a family by the series finale.
          </p>

        <div id="Sheldon" class="tabcontent">
          <h3>Sheldon Cooper</h3>
          <p>
            Played by actor Jim Parsons, Sheldon is a theoretical physicist from
            Texas, renowned for his intellect (IQ 187) and eidetic memory. He
            began college at 11 and earned his PhD at 16. Sheldon is known for
            his rigid routines, social awkwardness, and lack of empathy, but he
            does care deeply for his friends. He specializes in string theory
            and later wins a Nobel Prize with Amy. Sheldon’s quirks and literal
            interpretations of the world are central to the show’s humor.
          </p>

        <div id="Penny" class="tabcontent">
          <h3>Penny</h3>

            Omaha, Nebraska, who moves in across the hall from Leonard and
            Sheldon. Initially working as a waitress at The Cheesecake Factory,
            she later becomes a successful pharmaceutical sales representative.
            Penny is street-smart, friendly, and forms close bonds with
            Bernadette and Amy. Her on-and-off relationship with Leonard is a
            major storyline, culminating in their marriage.

        <div id="Howard" class="tabcontent">
          <h3>Howard Wolowitz</h3>

            a master's degree from MIT. He is Jewish and lives with his
            overbearing mother until he marries Bernadette. Unlike his friends,
            he does not have a doctorate. Howard is known for his flirtatious
            nature, love of gadgets, and eventually becomes an astronaut,
            traveling to the International Space Station.

            who works at Caltech. He initially cannot speak to women unless
            intoxicated, a condition that provides much comic relief. Raj is
            sensitive, romantic, and often struggles with loneliness and his
            parents’ expectations. He is close friends with Howard.

            awkward, she gradually becomes an integral part of the group and
            forms strong friendships with Penny and Bernadette. Amy’s
            relationship with Sheldon is central to her character, and together
            they win a Nobel Prize in Physics.

            personality.
